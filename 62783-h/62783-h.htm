<h2 class='nobreak'>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Lob Lie-by-the-fire</span>—the Lubber-fiend, as Milton calls
him—is a rough kind of Brownie or House Elf, supposed to
haunt some north-country homesteads, where he does the
work of the farm laborers, for no grander wages than</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Not that he is insensible of the pleasures of rest, for</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“—When, in one night, ere glimpse of morn,</p>
<p class='line0'>His shadowy flail hath threshed the corn</p>
<p class='line0'>That ten day-laborers could not end,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then lies him down the Lubber-fiend,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, stretched out all the chimney’s length,</p>
<p class='line0'>Basks at the fire his hairy strength.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It was said that a Lob Lie-by-the-fire once haunted the
little old Hall at Lingborough. It was an old stone house
on the Borders, and seemed to have got its tints from the
gray skies that hung above it. It was cold-looking without,
but cosy within, “like a north-country heart,” said Miss
Kitty, who was a woman of sentiment, and kept a common-place
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long before Miss Kitty’s time that Lob Lie-by-the-fire
first came to Lingborough. Why and whence he came
is not recorded, nor when and wherefore he withdrew his
valuable help, which, as wages rose, and prices rose also,
would have been more welcome than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tale professes not to record more of him than comes
within the memory of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether (as Fletcher says) he were the son of a witch, if
curds and cream won his heart, and new clothes put an end
to his labors, it does not pretend to tell. His history is less
known than that of any other sprite. It may be embodied
in some oral tradition that shall one day be found; but as
yet the mists of forgetfulness hide it from the story-teller
of to-day as deeply as the sea frogs are wont to lie between
Lingborough and the adjacent coast.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LITTLE OLD LADIES.—ALMS DONE IN SECRET.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> little old ladies of Lingborough were heiresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not, mind you, in the sense of being the children of some
mushroom millionaire, with more money than manners, and
(as Miss Betty had seen with her own eyes, on the daughter
of a manufacturer who shall be nameless) dresses so fine in
quality and be-furbelowed in construction as to cost a good
quarter’s income (of the little old ladies), but trailed in the
dirt from “beggarly extravagance,” or kicked out behind at
every step by feet which fortune (and a very large fortune
too) had never taught to walk properly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how should she know how to walk?” said Miss
Betty. “Her mother can’t have taught her, poor body! that
ran through the streets of Leith, with a creel on her back,
as a lassie; and got out of her coach (lined with satin, you
mind, sister Kitty?) to her dying day, with a bounce, all in
a heap, her dress caught, and her stockings exposed (among
ourselves, ladies!) like some good wife that’s afraid to be late
for the market. Aye, aye! Malcolm Midden—good man!—made
a fine pocket of silver in a dirty trade, but his women’ll
jerk, and toss, and bounce, and fuss, and fluster for a
generation or two yet, for all the silks and satins he can buy
’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this it will be seen that the little old ladies inherited
some prejudices of their class, and were also endowed with
a shrewdness of observation common among all classes of
north-country women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to return to what else they inherited. They were
heiresses, as the last representatives of a family as old in
that Border country as the bold blue hills which broke its
horizon. They were heiresses also in default of heirs male
to their father, who got the land from his uncle’s dying childless—sons
being scarce in the family. They were heiresses,
finally, to the place and the farm, to the furniture that was
made when folk seasoned their wood before they worked it,
to a diamond brooch which they wore by turns, besides two
diamond rings, and two black lace shawls, that had belonged
to their mother and their Auntie Jean, long since departed
thither where neither moth nor rust corrupt the true riches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the incomings of Lingborough, “It was nobody’s
business but their own,” as Miss Betty said to the lawyer
who was their man of business, and whom they consulted on
little matters of rent and repairs at as much length, and with
as much formal solemnity, as would have gone elsewhere to
the changing hands of half a million of money. Without
violating their confidence, however, we may say that the
estate paid its way, kept them in silk stockings, and gave
them new tabbinet dresses once in three years. It supplied
their wants the better that they had inherited house plenishing
from their parents, “which they thanked their stars was
not made of tag-rag, and would last their time,” and that
they were quite content with an old home and old neighbors,
and never desired to change the grand air that blew about
their native hills for worse, in order to be poisoned with bad
butter, and make the fortunes of extortionate lodging-house
keepers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rental of Lingborough did more. How much more
the little old ladies did not know themselves, and no one else
shall know till that which was done in secret is proclaimed
from the housetops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For they had had a religious scruple, founded upon a literal
reading of the scriptural command that a man’s left hand
should not know what his right hand gives in alms, and this
scruple had been ingeniously set at rest by the parson, who,
failing in an attempt to explain the force of eastern hyperbole
to the little ladies’ satisfaction, had said that Miss Betty,
being the elder, and the head of the house, might be likened
to the right hand, and Miss Kitty, as the younger, to the
left, and that if they pursued their good works without
ostentation, or desiring the applause even of each other, the
spirit of the injunction would be fulfilled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parson was a good man and a clever. He had (as
Miss Betty justly said) a very spiritual piety. But he was
also gifted with much shrewdness in dealing with the various
members of his flock. And his work was law to the sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it came about that the little ladies’ charities were not
known to each other—that Miss Betty turned her morning
camlet twice instead of once, and Miss Kitty denied herself
in sugar, to carry out benevolent little projects which were
accomplished in secret and of which no record appears in
the Lingborough ledger.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AT TEA WITH MRS. DUNMAW.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> little ladies of Lingborough were very sociable, and
there was, as they said, “as much gaiety as was good for
anyone” within their reach. There were at least six houses
at which they drank tea from time to time, all within a walk.
As hosts or guests, you always met the same people, which
was a friendly arrangement, and the programmes of the
entertainments were so uniform, that no one could possibly
feel awkward. The best of manners and home-made wines
distinguished these tea parties, where the company was
strictly genteel, if a little faded. Supper was served at
nine, and the parson and the lawyer played whist for love
with different partners on different evenings with strict impartiality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Small jealousies are apt to be weak points in small societies,
but there was a general acquiescence in the belief that
the parson had a friendly preference for the little ladies
of Lingborough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lived just beyond them, too, which led to his invariably
escorting them home. Miss Betty and Miss Kitty
would not for worlds have been so indelicate as to take this
attention for granted, though it was a custom of many years
standing. The older sister always went through the form
of asking the younger to “see if the servant had come,”
and at this signal the parson always bade the lady of the
house good night, and respectfully proffered his services as
an escort to Lingborough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lovely evening in June, when the little ladies
took tea with the widow of General Dunmaw at her cottage,
not quite two miles from their own home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a memorable evening. The tea party was an
agreeable one. The little ladies had new tabbinets on, and
Miss Kitty wore the diamond brooch. Miss Betty had
played whist with the parson, and the younger sister (perhaps
because of the brooch) had been favored with a good
deal of conversation with the lawyer. It was an honor,
because the lawyer bore the reputation of an <span class='it'>esprit fort</span>, and
was supposed to have, as a rule, a contempt for feminine
intellects, which good manners led him to veil under an
almost officious politeness in society. But honors are apt to
be uneasy blessings, and this one was at least as harassing as
gratifying. For a somewhat monotonous vein of sarcasm, a
painful power of producing puns, and a dexterity in suggesting
doubts of everything, were the main foundation of his
intellectual reputation, and Miss Kitty found them hard to
cope with. And it was a warm evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But women have much courage, especially to defend
a friend or a faith, and the less Miss Kitty found herself
prepared for the conflict the harder she esteemed it her duty
to fight. She fought for Church and State, for parsons and
poor people, for the sincerity of her friends, the virtues of
the Royal Family, the merit of Dr. Drugson’s prescriptions,
and for her favorite theory that there is some good in everyone
and some happiness to be found everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rubbed nervously at the diamond brooch with her
thin little mittened hands. She talked very fast; and if
the lawyer were guilty of feeling any ungallant indifference
to her observations, she did not so much as hear his, and
her cheeks became so flushed that Mrs. Dunmaw crossed the
room in her China crape shawl and said, “My dear Miss
Kitty, I’m sure you feel the heat very much. Do take my
fan, which is larger than yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Miss Kitty was saved a reply, for at this moment
Miss Betty turned on the sofa, and said, “Dear Kitty, will
you kindly see if the servant——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the parson closed the volume of ‘Friendship’s Offering’
which lay before him, and advanced towards Mrs.
Dunmaw and took leave in his own dignified way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kitty was so much flustered that she had not even
presence of mind to look for the servant, who had never
been ordered to come, but the parson relieved her by saying
in his round, deep voice, “I hope you will not refuse me the
honor of seeing you home, since our roads happen to lie together.”
And she was glad to get into the fresh air, and
beyond the doubtful compliments of the lawyer’s nasal
suavity—“You have been very severe upon me to-night,
Miss Kitty. I’m sure I had no notion I should find so
powerful an antagonist,” &amp;c.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>MIDSUMMER EVE—A LOST DIAMOND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was Midsummer eve. The long light of the North
was pale and clear, and the western sky shone luminous
through the fir-wood that bordered the road. Under such
dim lights colors deepen, and the great bushes of broom,
that were each one mass of golden blossom, blazed like fairy
watch-fires up the lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kitty leaned on the left arm of the parson and Miss
Betty on his right. She chatted gaily, which left her
younger sister at leisure to think of all the convincing
things she had not remembered to say to the lawyer, as the
evening breeze cooled her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A grand prospect for the crops, sir,” said Miss Betty;
“I never saw the broom so beautiful.” But as she leaned
forward to look at the yellow blaze which foretells good luck
to farmers, as it shone in the hedge on the left-hand side of
the road, she caught sight of the Brooch in Miss Kitty’s lace
shawl. Through a gap in the wood the light from the western
sky danced among the diamonds. But where one of
the precious stones should have been, there was a little black
hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister, you’ve lost a stone out of your brooch!” screamed
Miss Betty. The little ladies were well-trained, and even
in that moment of despair Miss Betty would not hint that
her sister’s ornaments were not her sole property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Miss Kitty burst into tears the parson was a little
astonished as well as distressed. Men are apt to be so, not
perhaps because women cry on such very small accounts, as
because the full reason does not always transpire. Tears
are often the climax of nervous exhaustion, and this is commonly
the result of more causes than one. Ostensibly Miss
Kitty was “upset” by the loss of the diamond, but she also
wept away a good deal of the vexation of her unequal conflict
with the sarcastic lawyer, and of all this the parson
knew nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty knew nothing of that, but she knew enough
of things in general to feel sure the diamond was not all the
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is amiss, sister Kitty?” said she. “Have you
hurt yourself? Do you feel ill? Did you know the stone
was out?”—“I hope you’re not going to be hysterical,
sister Kitty,” added Miss Betty anxiously; “there never
was a hysterical woman in our family yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear no, sister Betty,” sobbed Miss Kitty; “but
it’s all my fault. I know I was fidgeting with it whilst I
was talking; and it’s a punishment on my fidgety ways, and
for ever presuming to wear it at all, when you’re the head
of the family, and solely entitled to it. And I shall never
forgive myself if it’s lost, and if it’s found I’ll never, never
wear it any more.” And as she deluged her best company
pocket-handkerchief (for the useful one was in a big pocket
under her dress, and could not be got at, the parson being
present), Church, State, the Royal Family, the family
Bible, her highest principles, her dearest affections, and the
diamond brooch, all seemed to swim before her disturbed
mind in one sea of desolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not a kinder heart than the parson’s towards
women and children in distress. He tucked the little ladies
again under his arms, and insisted upon going back to Mrs.
Dunmaw’s, searching the lane as they went. In the pulpit
or the drawing-room a ready anecdote never failed him, and
on this occasion he had several. Tales of lost rings, and
even single gems, recovered in the most marvellous manner
and the most unexpected places—dug up in gardens, served
up to dinner in fishes, and so forth. “Never,” said Miss
Kitty, afterwards, “never, to her dying day, could she forget
his kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clung to the parson as a support under both her
sources of trouble, but Miss Betty ran on and back, and
hither and thither, looking for the diamond. Miss Kitty and
the parson looked too, and how many aggravating little bits
of glass and silica, and shining nothings and good-for-nothings
there are in the world, no one would believe who has not
looked for a lost diamond on a high road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But another story of found jewels was to be added to the
parson’s stock. He had bent his long back for about the
eighteenth time, when such a shimmer as no glass or silica
can give flashed into his eyes, and he caught up the diamond
out of the dust, and it fitted exactly into the little black hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kitty uttered a cry, and at the same moment Miss
Betty, who was farther down the road, did the same, and these
were followed by a third, which sounded like a mocking echo
of both. And then the sisters rushed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most miraculous discovery!” gasped Miss Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have passed the very spot before,” cried Miss
Kitty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though I’m sure, sister, what to do with it now we have
found it I don’t know,” said Miss Betty, rubbing her nose,
as she was wont to do when puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be taken better care of for the future, sister Betty,”
said Miss Kitty, penitently. “Though how it got out I
can’t think now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, bless my soul! you don’t suppose it got there of
itself, sister?” snapped Miss Betty. “How did it get there
is another matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt pretty confident about it, for my own part,” smiled
the parson as he joined them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say, sir, that you knew it was there?”
asked Miss Betty, solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know the precise spot, my dear madam,
but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t see it, sir, I hope?” said Miss Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, my dear madam, I found it!” cried the parson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty bridled and bit her lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never contradict a clergyman, sir,” said she, “but I
can only say that if you did see it, it was not like your usual
humanity to leave it lying there.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>cried the parson and Miss Kitty in one breath. Miss Betty
was too much puzzled to be polite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you talking about?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The diamond, oh dear, oh dear! <span class='it'>The Diamond!</span>”
cried Miss Kitty. “But what are you talking about, sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The Baby</span>,” said Miss Betty.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>WHAT MISS BETTY FOUND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was found under a broom-bush. Miss Betty was poking
her nose near the bank that bordered the wood, in her
hunt for the diamond, when she caught sight of a mass of
yellow of a deeper tint that the mass of broom-blossom
above it, and this was the baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This vivid color, less opaque than “deep chrome” and a
shade more orange, seems to have a peculiar attraction for
wandering tribes. Gipsies use it, and it is a favorite color
with Indian squaws. To the last dirty rag it is effective,
whether it flutters near a tent on Bagshot Heath, or in some
wigwam doorway makes a point of brightness against the
gray shadows of the pine forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large kerchief of this, wound about its body, was the
baby’s only robe, but he seemed quite comfortable in it when
Miss Betty found him, sleeping on a pillow of deep hair
moss, his little brown fists closed as fast as his eyes, and a
crimson toadstool grasped in one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Miss Betty screamed the baby awoke, and his long
black lashes tickled his cheeks and made him wink and cry.
But by the time she returned with her sister and the parson,
he was quite happy again, gazing up with dark eyes full of
delight into the glowing broom-bush, and fighting the evening
breeze with his feet, which were entangled in the folds
of the yellow cloth, and with the battered toadstool which
was still in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, indeed, sir,” said Miss Betty, who had rubbed her
nose till it looked like the twin toadstool to that which the
baby was flourishing in her face, “you won’t suppose I would
have left the poor little thing another moment, to catch its
death of cold on a warm evening like this; but having no
experience of such cases, and remembering that murder at
the inn in the Black Valley, and that the body was not allowed
to be moved till the constables had seen it, I didn’t
feel to know how it might be with foundlings, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still Miss Betty did not touch the bairn. She was not
accustomed to children. But the parson had christened too
many babies to be afraid of them, and he picked up the little
fellow in a moment, and tucked the yellow rag round him,
and then addressing the little ladies precisely as if they were
sponsors, he asked in his deep round voice, “Now where on
the face of earth are the vagabonds who have deserted
this child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little ladies did not know, the broom-bushes were silent,
and the question has remained unanswered from that
day to this.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE BABY, THE LAWYER, AND THE PARSON.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There were no railways near Lingborough at this time.
The coach ran three times a week, and a walking postman
brought the letters from the town to the small hamlets. Telegraph
wires were unknown, and yet news traveled quite as
fast then as it does now, and in the course of the following
morning all the neighborhood knew that Miss Betty had
found a baby under a broom-bush, and the lawyer called in
the afternoon to inquire how the ladies found themselves after
the tea party at Mrs. General Dunmaw’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kitty was glad on the whole. She felt nervous, but
ready for a renewal of hostilities. Several clinching arguments
had occurred to her in bed last night, and after hastily
looking up a few lines from her common-place book, which
always made her cry when she read them, but which she
hoped to be able to hurl at the lawyer with a steady voice,
she followed Miss Betty to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was half a relief and half a disappointment to find that
the lawyer was quite indifferent to the subject of their late
contest. He overflowed with compliments; was quite sure
he must have had the worst of the argument, and positively
dying of curiosity to hear about the baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little ladies were very full of the subject themselves.
An active search for the baby’s relations, conducted by the
parson, the clerk, the farm-bailiff, the constable, the cowherd,
and several supernumeraries, had so far proved quite vain.
The country folk were most anxious to assist, especially by
word of mouth. Except a small but sturdy number who had
seen nothing, they had all seen “tramps,” but unluckily no
two could be got together whose accounts of the tramps
themselves, of the hour at which they were seen, or of the
direction in which they went, would tally with each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little ladies were quite alive to the possibility that the
child’s parents might never be traced, indeed the matter had
been constantly before their minds ever since the parson had
carried the baby to Lingborough, and laid it in the arms
of Thomasina, the servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty had sat long before her toilette-table that evening,
gazing vacantly at the looking-glass. Not that the reflection
of the eight curl-papers she had neatly twisted up
was conveyed to her brain. She was in a brown study, during
which the following thoughts passed through her mind,
and they all pointed one way:</p>

<p class='pindent'>That that fine little fellow was not to blame for his people’s
misconduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That they would never be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That it would probably be the means of the poor child’s
ruin, body and soul, if they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the master of the neighboring workhouse bore a bad
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That a child costs nothing to keep—where cows are kept
too—for years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That just at the age when a boy begins to eat dreadfully
and wear out his clothes, he is very useful on a farm (though
not for these reasons).</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Thomasina had taken to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That there need be no nonsense about it, as he could be
brought up in his proper station in life in the kitchen and the
farmyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That tramps have souls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That he would be taught to say his prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty said hers, and went to bed; but all through
that midsummer night the baby kept her awake, or flaunted
his yellow robe and crimson toadstool through her dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning brought no change in Miss Betty’s views,
but she felt doubtful as to how her sister would receive them.
Would she regard them as foolish and unpractical, and her
respect for Miss Betty’s opinion be lessened thenceforward?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fear was needless. Miss Kitty was romantic and imaginative.
She had carried the baby through his boyhood
about the Lingborough fields whilst she was dressing; and
he was attending her own funeral in the capacity of an
attached and faithful servant, in black livery with worsted
frogs, as she sprinkled salt on her buttered toast at breakfast,
when she was startled from this affecting day-dream by
Miss Betty’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear sister Kitty, I wish to consult you as to our plans
in the event of those wicked people who deserted the baby
not being found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little ladies resolved that not an inkling of their benevolent
scheme must be betrayed to the lawyer. But they
dissembled awkwardly, and the tone in which they spoke of
the tramp-baby roused the lawyer’s quick suspicions. He
had a real respect for the little ladies, and was kindly anxious
to save them from their own indiscretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear ladies,” said he, “I do hope your benevolence—may
I say your romantic benevolence?—of disposition is
not tempting you to adopt this gipsy waif?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope we know what is due to ourselves, and to the
estate—small as it is—sir,” said Miss Betty, “as well as to
Providence, too well to attempt to raise any child, however
handsome, from that station of life in which he was born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, madam! I never dreamed you would adopt
a beggar child as your heir; but I hope you mean to send it
to the workhouse, if the gipsy tramps it belongs to are not to
be found?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have not made up our minds, sir, as to the course
we propose to pursue,” said Miss Betty, with outward dignity
proportioned to her inward doubts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear ladies,” said the lawyer anxiously, “let me implore
you not to be rash. To adopt a child in the most
favorable circumstances is the greatest of risks. But if
your benevolence <span class='it'>will</span> take that line, pray adopt some little
boy out of one of your tenants’ families. Even your teaching
will not make him brilliant, as he is likely to inherit the
minimum of intellectual capacity; but he will learn his catechism,
probably grow up respectable, and possibly grateful,
since his forefathers have (so Miss Kitty assures me) had all
these virtues for generations. But this baby is the child of
a heathen, barbarous, and wandering race. The propensities
of the vagabonds who have deserted him are in every
drop of his blood. All the parsons in the diocese won’t
make a Christian of him, and when (after anxieties I shudder
to foresee) you flatter yourselves that he is civilized, he
will run away and leave his shoes and stockings behind him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has a soul to be saved, if he is a gipsy,” said Miss
Kitty, hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The soul, my dear Miss Kitty”—began the lawyer,
facing round upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say anything dreadful about the soul, sir, I beg,”
said Miss Betty, firmly. And then she added in a conciliatory
tone, “Won’t you look at the little fellow, sir? I
have no doubt his relations are shocking people; but when
you see his innocent little face and his beautiful eyes, I think
you’ll say yourself that if he were a duke’s son he couldn’t
be a finer child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My experience of babies is so limited, Miss Betty,”
said the lawyer, “that really—if you’ll excuse me—but I
can quite imagine him. I have before now been tempted
myself to adopt stray—puppies, when I have seen them in
the round, soft, innocent, bright-eyed stage. And when they
have grown up in the hands of more credulous friends into
lanky, ill-conditioned, misconducted curs, I have congratulated
myself that I was not misled by the graces of an age
at which ill-breeding is less apparent than later in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little ladies both rose. “If you see no difference,
sir,” said Miss Betsy in her stateliest manner, “between a
babe with an immortal soul and the beasts that perish, it is
quite useless to prolong the conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reason is apt to be useless when opposed to the generous
impulses of a sex so full of sentiment as yours, madam,”
said the lawyer, rising also. “Permit me to take a long
farewell, since it is improbable that our friendship will resume
its old position until your <span class='it'>protegé</span> has—run away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words “long farewell” and “old friendship” were
quite sufficient to soften wrath in the tender hearts of the little
ladies. But the lawyer had really lost his temper, and,
before Miss Betty had decided how to offer the olive branch
without conceding her principles he was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather was warm. The little ladies were heated by
discussion and the parson by vain scouring of the country on
foot, when they asked his advice upon their project, and
related their conversation with the lawyer. The two gentlemen
had so little in common that the parson felt it his duty
not to let his advice be prejudiced by this fact. For some
moments he sat silent, then he began to walk about as if he
were composing a sermon; then he stepped before the little
ladies (who were sitting as stiffly on the sofa as if it were a
pew) and spoke as if he were delivering one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you ask me, dear ladies, whether it is your duty to
provide for this child because you found him, I say that
there is no such obligation. If you ask if I think it wise in
your own interests, and hopeful as to the boy’s career, I am
obliged to agree with your legal adviser. Vagabond ways
are seldom cured in one generation, and I think it is quite
probable that, after much trouble and anxiety spent upon
him, he may go back to a wandering life. But, Miss Betty,”
continued the parson in deepening tones, as he pounded his
left palm with his right fist for want of a pulpit, “If you ask
me whether I believe any child of any race is born incapable
of improvement, and beyond benefit from the charities we
owe to each other, I should deny my faith if I could say
yes. I shall not, madam, confuse the end of your connection
with him with the end of your training in him, even if he
runs away, or fancy that I see the one because I see the
other. I do not pretend to know how much evil he inherits
from his forefathers as accurately as our graphic friend; but
I do know that he has a Father whose image is also to be
found in His children—not quite effaced in any of them—and
whose care of this one will last when yours, madam,
may seem to have been in vain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the little ladies rushed forward and each shook a hand
of the parson, he felt some compunction for his speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear I am encouraging you in grave indiscretion,” said
he. “But, indeed, my dear ladies, I am quite against your
project, for you do not realize the anxieties and disappointments
that are before you, I am sure. The child will give
you infinite trouble. I think he will run away. And yet I
cannot in good conscience say that I believe love’s labor
must be lost. He may return to the woods and wilds; but
I hope he will carry something with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did the reverend gentleman mean Miss Betty’s teaspoons?”
asked the lawyer, stroking his long chin, when he
was told what the person had said.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BABYHOOD.—PRETTY FLOWERS.—THE ROSE-COLORED TULIPS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> matter of the baby’s cap disturbed the little ladies.
It seemed so like the beginning of a fulfilment of the lawyer’s
croakings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kitty had made it. She had never seen a baby
without a cap before, and the sight was unusual, if not indecent.
But Miss Kitty was a quick needlewoman, and
when the new cap was fairly tied over the thick crop of silky
black hair, the baby looked so much less like Puck, and so
much more like the rest of the baby world, that it was quite
a relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kitty’s feelings may therefore be imagined when
going to the baby just after the parson’s departure, she
found him in open rebellion against his cap. It had been
tied on whilst he was asleep, and his eyes were no sooner
open than he commenced the attack. He pulled with one
little brown hand and tugged with the other; he dragged a
rosette over his nose and got the frills into his eyes; he
worried it as a puppy worries your handkerchief if you tie it
round its face and tell it to “look like a grandmother.” At
last the strings gave way, and he cast it triumphantly out of
the clothes-basket which served him for cradle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Successive efforts to induce him to wear it proved vain, so
Thomasina said the weather was warm and his hair was very
thick, and she parted this and brushed it, and Miss Kitty
gave the cap to the farm-bailiff’s baby, who took to it as
kindly as a dumpling to a pudding-cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the boy was ever kept inside his christening clothes,
Thomasina said she did not know. But when he got into
the parson’s arms he lay quite quiet, which was a good omen.
That he might lack no advantage, Miss Betty stood godmother
for him, and the parish clerk and the sexton were
his godfathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was named John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A plain, sensible name,” said Miss Betty. “And while
we are about it,” she added, “we may as well choose his
surname. For a surname he must have, and the sooner it is
decided upon the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kitty had made a list of twenty-seven of her favorite
Christian names which Miss Betty had sternly rejected,
that everything might be plain, practical, and respectable at
the outset of the tramp-child’s career. For the same reason
she refused to adopt Miss Kitty’s suggestions for a surname.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so seldom there’s a chance of <span class='it'>choosing</span> a surname for
anybody, sister,” said Miss Kitty, “it seems a pity not to
choose a pretty one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister Kitty,” said Miss Betty, “don’t be romantic.
The boy is to be brought up in that station of life for which
one syllable is ample. I should have called him Smith if
that had not been Thomasina’s name. As it is, I propose
to call him Broom. He was found under a bush of broom,
and it goes very well with John, and sounds plain and respectable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Miss Betty bought a Bible, and on the fly-leaf of it
she wrote in her fine, round, gentlewoman’s writing—“<span class='it'>John
Broom. With good wishes for his welfare, temporal and
eternal. From a sincere friend.</span>” And when the inscription
was dry the Bible was wrapped in brown paper, and put by
in Thomasina’s trunk till John Broom should come to years
of discretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was slow to reach them, though in other respects he
grew fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he began to walk he would walk barefoot. To be
out of doors was his delight, but on the threshold of the
house he always sat down and discarded his shoes and stockings.
Thomasina bastinadoed the soles of his feet with the
soles of his shoes “to teach him the use of them,” so she
said. But Miss Kitty sighed and thought of the lawyer’s
prediction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no blinking the fact that the child was as
troublesome as he was pretty. The very demon of mischief
danced in his black eyes, and seemed to possess his feet and
fingers as if with quicksilver. And if, as Thomasina said,
you “never knew what he would be at next,” you might also
be pretty sure that it would be something he ought to have
left undone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom early developed a taste for glass and
crockery, and as the china cupboard was in that part of the
house to which he by social standing also belonged, he had
many chances to seize upon cups, jugs and dishes. If detected
with anything that he ought not to have had, it was
his custom to drop the forbidden toy and toddle off as fast as
his unpractised feet would carry him. The havoc which
this caused amongst the glass and china was bewildering in
a household where tea-sets and dinner-sets had passed from
generation to generation, where slapdash, giddy-pated
kitchen-maids never came, where Miss Betty washed the
best teacups in the parlor, where Thomasina was more careful
than her mistress, and the breaking of a single plate was
a serious matter, and if beyond riveting, a misfortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thomasina soon found that her charge was safest, as he
was happiest, out of doors. A very successful device was to
shut him up in the drying-ground, and tell him to “pick the
pretty flowers.” John Broom preferred flowers even to
china cups with gilding on them. He gathered nosegays of
daisies and buttercups, and the winning way in which he
would present these to the little ladies atoned, in their benevolent
eyes, for many a smashed teacup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the tramp-baby’s restless spirit was soon weary of
the drying ground, and he set forth one morning in search
of “fresh fields and pastures new.” He had seated himself
on the threshold to take off his shoes, when he heard the
sound of Thomasina’s footsteps, and, hastily staggering to
his feet, toddled forth without farther delay. The sky was
blue above him, the sun was shining, and the air was very
sweet. He ran for a bit and then tumbled, and picked himself
up again, and got a fresh impetus, and so on till he
reached the door of the kitchen garden, which was open. It
was an old-fashioned kitchen-garden with flowers in the
borders. There were single rose-colored tulips which had
been in the garden as long as Miss Betty could remember,
and they had been so increased by dividing the clumps that
they now stretched in two rich lines of color down both sides
of the long walk. And John Broom saw them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pick the pretty f’owers, love,” said he, in imitation of
Thomasina’s patronising tone, and forthwith beginning at the
end, he went steadily to the top of the right-hand border
mowing the rose-colored tulips as he went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, when Thomasina came to look for him, he
could not be found, and when all the back premises and the
drying-ground had been searched in vain, she gave the alarm
to the little ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kitty’s vivid imagination leaped at once to the conclusion
that the child’s vagabond relations had fetched him
away, and she became rigid with alarm. But Miss Betty
rushed out into the shrubbery and Miss Kitty took a whiff
of her vinaigrette and followed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they came at last to the kitchen-garden, Miss
Betty’s grief for the loss of John Broom did not prevent
her observing that there was something odd about the
borders, and when she got to the top, and found that all the
tulips had been picked from one side, she sank down on the
roller which happened to be lying beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And John Broom staggered up to her, and crying “For
’oo, Miss Betty,” fell headlong with a sheaf of rose-colored
tulips into her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he did not offer any to Miss Kitty, her better judgment
was not warped, and she said, “You must slap him,
sister Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put out your hand, John Broom,” said Miss Betty, much
agitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And John Broom, who was quite composed, put out both
his little grubby paws so trustfully that Miss Betty had not
the heart to strike him. But she scolded him, “Naughty
boy!” and she pointed to the tulips and shook her head.
John Broom looked thoughtfully at them, and shook his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naughty boy!” repeated Miss Betty, and she added in
very impressive tones, “John Broom’s a very naughty boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After which she took him to Thomasina, and Miss Kitty
collected the rose-colored tulips and put them into water in
the best old china punch-bowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the afternoon she peeped into the kitchen,
where John Broom sat on the floor, under the window, gazing
thoughtfully up into the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As good as gold, bless his little heart!” murmured Miss
Kitty. For as his feet were tucked under him, she did not
know that he had just put his shoes and stockings into the
pig-tub, into which he all but fell himself from the exertion.
He did not hear Miss Kitty, and thought on. He wanted to
be out again, and he had a tantalising remembrance of the
ease with which the tender juicy stalks of the tulips went
snap, snap, in that new place of amusement he had discovered.
Thomasina looked into the kitchen and went away
again. When she had gone, John Broom went away also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went both faster and steadier on his bare feet, and
when he got into the kitchen garden, it recalled Miss Betty
to his mind. And he shook his head, and said, “Naughty
boy!” And then he went up the left-hand border, mowing
the tulips as he went; after which he trotted home, and met
Thomasina at the back door. And he hugged the sheaf of
rose-colored tulips in his arms, and said, “John Broom a
very naughty boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thomasina was not sentimental, and she slapped him well—his
hands for picking the tulips and his feet for going
barefoot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his feet had to be slapped with Thomasina’s slipper,
for his own shoes could not be found.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>EDUCATION.—FIRESIDE TALES.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> spite of all his pranks, John Broom did not lose the
favor of his friends. Thomasina spoiled him, and Miss
Betty and Miss Kitty tried not to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parson had said, “Treat the child fairly. Bring him
up as he will have to live hereafter. Don’t make him half
pet and half-servant.” And following this advice, and her
own resolve that there should be “no nonsense” in the
matter, Miss Betty had made it a rule that he should not be
admitted to the parlor. It bore more heavily on the
tender hearts of the little ladies than on the light heart of
John Broom, and led to their waylaying him in the passages
and gardens with little gifts, unknown to each other. And
when Miss Kitty kissed his newly-washed cheeks, and pronounced
them “like ripe russets,” Miss Betty murmured,
“Be judicious, sister Kitty;” and Miss Kitty would correct
any possible ill effects by saying, “<span class='it'>Now</span> make your bow to
your betters, John Broom, and say, ‘Thank you, ma’am!’ ”
which was accomplished by the child’s giving a tug to the
forelock of his thick black hair, with a world of mischief in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was old enough, the little ladies sent him to the
village school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The total failure of their hopes for his education was not
the smallest of the disappointments Miss Betty and Miss
Kitty endured on his behalf. The quarrel with the lawyer
had been made up long ago, and though there was always a
touch of raillery in his inquiries after “the young gipsy,”
he had once said, “If he turns out anything of a genius at
school, I might find a place for him in the office, by-and-by.”
The lawyer was kind-hearted in his own fashion, and on this
hint Miss Kitty built up hopes, which unhappily were met
by no responsive ambition in John Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to his fitness to be an errand boy, he could not carry a
message from the kitchen to the cowhouse without stopping
by the way to play with the yard-dog, and a hedgehog in the
path would probably have led him astray, if Thomasina had
had a fit and he had been dispatched for a doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During school hours he spent most of his time under the
fool’s-cap when he was not playing truant. With his school-mates
he was good friends. If he was seldom out of mischief,
he was seldom out of temper. He could beat any boy
at a foot-race (without shoes); he knew the notes and nests
of every bird that sang, and whatever an old pocket-knife is
capable of, that John Broom could and would do with it for
his fellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty had herself tried to teach him to read, and
she continued to be responsible for his religious instruction.
She had tried to stir up his industry by showing him the
Bible, and promising that when he could read it he should
have it for his “very own.” But he either could not or
would not apply himself, so the prize lay unearned in Thomasina’s
trunk. But he would listen for any length of time
to Scripture stories, if they were read or told to him, especially
to the history of Elisha, and the adventures of the
Judges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, since he could no longer be shut up in the drying-ground,
Thomasina had found that he was never so happy
and so safe as when he was listening to tales, and many a
long winter evening he lay idle on the kitchen hearth, with
his head on the sheep dog, whilst the more industrious
Thomasina plied her knitting-needles, as she sat in the ingle-nook,
with the flickering firelight playing among the plaits
of her large cap, and told tales of the country side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that John Broom was her only hearer. Annie “the
lass” sat by the hearth also, and Thomasina took care that
she did not “sit with her hands before her.” And a little
farther away sat the cowherd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a sleeping-room above the barn, and took his
meals in the house. By Miss Betty’s desire he always went
in to family prayers after supper, when he sat as close as
possible to the door, under an uncomfortable consciousness
that Thomasina did not think his boots clean enough for the
occasion, and would find something to pick off the carpet as
she followed him out, however hardly he might have used
the door-scraper beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might be a difficult matter to decide which he liked
best, beer or John Broom. But next to these he liked
Thomasina’s stories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thomasina was kind to him. With all his failings and
the dirt on his boots, she liked him better than the farm-bailiff.
The farm-bailiff was thrifty and sensible and faithful,
and Thomasina was faithful and sensible and thrifty, and
they each had a tendency to claim the monopoly of those
virtues. Notable people complain, very properly, of thriftless
and untidy ones, but they sometimes agree better with
them than with rival notabilities. And so Thomasina’s
broad face beamed benevolently as she bid the cowherd
“draw up” to the fire, and he who (like Thomasina) was a
native of the country, would confirm the marvels she related,
with a proper pride in the wonderful district to which they
both belonged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would help her out sometimes with names and dates
in a local biography. By his own account he knew the man
who was murdered at the inn in the Black Valley so intimately
that it turned Annie the lass as white as a dish-cloth
to sit beside him. If Thomasina said that folk were yet
alive who had seen the little green men dance in Dawborough
Croft, the cowherd would smack his knees and cry,
“Scores on ’em!” And when she whispered of the white
figure which stood at the cross roads after midnight, he testified
to having seen it himself—tall beyond mortal height,
and pointing four ways at once. He had a legend of his
own too, which Thomasina sometimes gave him the chance
of telling, of how he was followed home one moonlight
night by a black Something as big as a young calf, which
“wimmled and wammled” around him till he fell senseless
into the ditch, and being found there by the farm-bailiff on
his return from market, was unjustly accused of the vice of
intoxication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fault-finders should be free of flaws,” Thomasina would
say with a prim chin. She <span class='it'>had</span> seen the farm-bailiff himself
“the worse” for more than his supper beer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was one history which Thomasina was always
loth to relate, and it was that which both John Broom and
the cowherd especially preferred—the history of Lob Lie-by-the-fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thomasina had a feeling (which was shared by Annie the
lass) that it was better not to talk of “anything” peculiar
to the house in which you were living. One’s neighbors’
ghosts and bogles are another matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to John Broom and the cowherd no subject was so
interesting as that of the Lubber-fiend. The cowherd sighed
to think of the good old times when a man might sleep on in
spite of cocks, and the stables be cleaner, and the beasts
better tended than if he had been up with the lark. And
John Broom’s curiosity was never quenched about the rough,
hairy Good-fellow who worked at night that others might
be idle by day, and who was sometimes caught at his hard-earned
nap, lying, “like a great hurgin bear,” where the
boy loved to lie himself, before the fire, on this very hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why and where he had gone, Thomasina could not tell.
She had heard that he had originally come from some other
household, where he had been offended. But whether he
had gone elsewhere when he forsook Lingborough, or
whether “such things had left the country” for good, she
did not pretend to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she had told, for the third or fourth time, how
his porridge was put into a corner of the cowhouse for him
overnight, and how he had been often overheard at his work,
but rarely seen, and then only lying before the fire, Miss
Betty would ring for prayers, and Thomasina would fold up
her knitting and lead the way, followed by Annie the lass,
whose nerves John Broom would startle by treading on her
heels, the rear being brought up by the cowherd, looking
hopelessly at his boots.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE FARM-BAILIFF.—PRETTY COCKY.—IN THE WILLOW TREE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Miss</span> Betty and Miss Kitty did really deny themselves
the indulgence of being indulgent, and treated John Broom
on principles, and for his good. But they did so in their
own tremulous and spasmodic way, and got little credit for
it. Thomasina, on the other hand, spoiled him with such a
masterful managing air, and so much sensible talk, that no
one would have thought that the only system she followed
was to conceal his misdemeanors, and to stand between him
and the just wrath of the farm-bailiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farm-bailiff, or grieve, as he liked to call himself,
was a Scotchman, with a hard-featured face (which he
washed on the Sabbath), a harsh voice, a good heart rather
deeper down in his body than is usual, and a shrewd, money-getting
head, with a speckled straw hat on the top of it. No
one could venture to imagine when that hat was new, or
how long ago it was that the farm-bailiff went to the expense
of purchasing those work-day clothes. But the dirt on his
face and neck was an orderly accumulation, such as gathers
on walls, oil-paintings, and other places to which soap is not
habitually applied; it was not a matter of spills and splashes,
like the dirt John Broom disgraced himself with. And his
clothes, if old, fitted neatly about him; they never suggested
raggedness, which was the normal condition of the tramp-boy’s
jackets. They only looked as if he had been born
(and occasionally buried) in them. It is needful to make
this distinction, that the good man may not be accused of
inconsistency in the peculiar vexation which John Broom’s
disorderly appearance caused him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, Miss Betty’s <span class='it'>protegé</span> had reached the age at
which he was to “eat dreadfully, wear out his clothes, and
be useful on the farm;” and the last condition was quite
unfulfilled. At eleven years old he could not be trusted to
scare birds, and at half that age the farm-bailiff’s eldest
child could drive cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And no’ just ruin the leddies in new coats and compliments,
either, like some ne’er-do-weels,” added the farm-bailiff,
who had heard with a jealous ear of six-pences given
by Miss Betty and Miss Kitty to their wasteful favorite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the eleventh anniversary of John Broom’s discovery
was passed, and his character at school gave no hopes of
his ever qualifying himself to serve the lawyer, it was
resolved that—“idleness being the mother of mischief,” he
should be put under the care of the farm-bailiff, to do such
odd jobs about the place as might be suited to his capacity
and love of out-door life. And now John Broom’s troubles
began. By fair means or foul, with here an hour’s weeding
and there a day’s bird scaring, and with errands perpetual,
the farm-bailiff contrived to “get some work out of” the
idle little urchin. His speckled hat and grim face seemed
to be everywhere, and always to pop up when John Broom
began to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lived “at daggers drawn.” I am sorry to say that
John Broom’s fitful industry was still kept for his own fancies.
To climb trees, to run races with the sheep dog, to cut
grotesque sticks, gather hedge fruits, explore a bog, or make
new friends among beasts and birds—at such matters he
would labor with feverish zeal. But so far from trying to
cure himself of his indolence about daily drudgery, he found
a new and pleasant excitement in thwarting the farm-bailiff
at every turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would not sound dignified to say that the farm-bailiff
took pleasure in thwarting John Broom. But he certainly
did not show his satisfaction when the boy did do his work
properly. Perhaps he thought that praise is not good for
young people; and the child did not often give him the
chance of trying. Of blame he was free enough. Not a
good scolding to clear the air, such as Thomasina would
give to Annie the lass, but his slow, caustic tongue was
always growling, like muttered thunder, over John Broom’s
incorrigible head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has never approved of the tramp-child, who had the
overwhelming drawbacks of having no pedigree and of being
a bad bargain as to expense. This was not altogether John
Broom’s fault, but with his personal failings the farm-bailiff
had even less sympathy. It has been hinted that he was
born in the speckled hat, and whether this were so or not,
he certainly had worn an old head whilst his shoulders were
still young, and could not remember the time when he
wished to waste his energies on anything that did not earn
or at least save something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once only did anything like approval of the lad escape
his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty’s uncle’s second cousin had returned from
foreign lands with a good fortune and several white cockatoos.
He kept the fortune himself, but he gave the cockatoos
to his friends, and he sent one of them to the little
ladies of Lingborough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a lovely creature (the cockatoo, not the cousin,
who was plain), and John Broom’s admiration of him was
boundless. He gazed at the sulphur-colored crest, the pure
white wings with their deeper-tinted lining, and even the
beak and the fierce round eyes, as he had gazed at the
broom bush in his babyhood, with insatiable delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cousin did things handsomely. He had had a ring
put around one of the cockatoo’s ankles, with a bright steel
chain attached and a fastener to secure it to the perch. The
cockatoo was sent in the cage by coach, and the perch,
made of foreign wood, followed by the carrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty and Miss Kitty were delighted both with the
cockatoo and the perch, but they were a good deal troubled
as to how to fasten the two together. There was a neat little
ring on the perch, and the cockatoo’s chain was quite
complete, and he evidently wanted to get out, for he shook
the walls of his cage in his gambols. But he put up his crest
and snapped when any one approached, in a manner so
alarming that Annie the lass shut herself up in the dairy,
and the farm-bailiff turned his speckled hat in his hands, and
gave cautious counsel from a safe distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How he flaps!” cried Miss Betty. “I’m afraid he has
a very vicious temper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He only wants to get out, Miss Betty,” said John Broom.
“He’d be all right with his perch, and I think I can get him
on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now heaven save us from the sin o’ presumption!”
cried the farm-bailiff, and putting on the speckled hat, he
added, slowly: “I’m thinking, John Broom, that if ye’re
engaged wi’ the leddies this morning it’ll be time I turned
my hand to singling these few turnips ye’ve been thinking
about the week past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On which he departed, and John Broom pressed the little
ladies to leave him alone with the bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shouldn’t like to leave you alone with a wild creature
like that,” said Miss Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s just frightened on ye, Miss Betty. He’ll be like a
lamb when you’re gone,” urged John Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, we should like to see you do it,” said Miss
Kitty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can look in through the window, miss. I must
fasten the door, or he’ll be out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should never forgive myself if he hurt you, John,” said
Miss Betty, irresolutely, for she was very anxious to have
the cockatoo and perch in full glory in the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll none hurt me, miss,” said John, with a cheerful
smile on his rosy face. “I likes him, and he’ll like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This settled the matter. John was left with the cockatoo.
He locked the door, and the little ladies went into the garden
and peeped through the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw John Broom approach the cage, on which the
cockatoo put up his crest, opened his beak slowly, and
snarled, and Miss Betty tapped on the window and shook
her black satin workbag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t go near him!” she cried. But John Broom paid
no attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you putting up that top-knot of yours at me
for?” said he to the cockatoo. “Don’t ye know your own
friends? I’m going to let ye out, I am. You’re going on to
your perch, you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh, but you’re a bonny creature!” he added, as the
cockatoo filled the cage with snow and sulphur flutterings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep away, keep away!” screamed the little ladies,
playing a duet on the window panes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out with you!” said John Broom, as he unfastened the
cage door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And just when Miss Betty had run round, and as she
shouted through the key-hole, “Open the door, John Broom,
we’ve changed our minds; we’ve decided to keep it in its
cage,” the cockatoo strode solemnly forth on his eight long
toes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty Cocky!” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Miss Betty got back to the window, John Broom
had just made an injudicious grab at the steel chain, on
which Pretty Cocky flew fiercely at him, and John, burying
his face in his arms, received the attack on his thick poll,
laughing into his sleeves and holding fast to the chain,
whilst the cockatoo and the little ladies screamed against
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll break your leg—you’ll tear its eyes out!” cried
Miss Kitty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Kitty means that you’ll break its leg, and it will
tear your eyes out,” Miss Betty explained through the glass.
“John Broom! Come away! Lock it in! Let it go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Cocky was now waddling solemnly round the room,
and John Broom was creeping after him, with the end of the
chain in one hand, and the perch in the other, and in a moment
more he had joined the chain and the ring, and just as
Miss Betty was about to send for the constable and have the
door broken open, Cocky—driven into a corner—clutched
his perch, and was raised triumphantly to his place in the
bow-window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was now a parlor pet, and John Broom saw little of
him. This vexed him, for he had taken a passionate liking
for the bird. The little ladies rewarded him well for his
skill, but this brought him no favor from the farm-bailiff, and
matters went on as ill as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day the cockatoo got his chain entangled, and Miss
Kitty promptly advanced to put it right. She had unfastened
that end which secured it to the perch, when Cocky,
who had been watching the proceeding with much interest,
dabbed at her with his beak. Miss Kitty fled, but with
great presence of mind shut the door after her. She forgot,
however, that the window was open, in front of which stood
the cockatoo scanning the summer sky with his fierce eyes,
and flapping himself in the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And just as the little ladies ran into the garden, and Miss
Kitty was saying, “One comfort is, sister Betty, that it’s
quite safe in the room, till we can think what to do next,”
he bowed his yellow crest, spread his noble wings, and sailed
out into the ether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In ten minutes the whole able-bodied population of the
place was in the grounds of Lingborough, including the
farm-bailiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cockatoo was on the top of a fir-tree, and a fragment
of the chain was with him, for he had broken it, and below
on the lawn stood the little ladies, who, with the unfailing
courage of women in a hopeless cause, were trying to dislodge
him by waving their pocket-handkerchiefs and crying
“sh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked composedly down out of one eye for some time,
and then he began to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s coming down now,” said Miss Kitty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a quarter of a minute, Cocky had sailed a quarter of
a mile, and was rocking himself on the top of an old willow tree.
And at this moment John Broom joined the crowd
which followed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m thinking he’s got his chain fast,” said the farm-bailiff;
“if anybody that understood the beastie daured to
get near him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get him,” said John Broom, casting down his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’ll get your neck thrawed,” said the farm-bailiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We won’t hear of it,” said the little ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to their horror, John Broom kicked off his shoes
after which he spat upon his hands (a shock which Miss
Kitty thought she never could have survived), and away he
went up the willow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not an easy tree to climb, and he had one or two
narrow escapes, which kept the crowd breathless, but he
shook the hair from his eyes, moistened his hands afresh,
and went on. The farm-bailiff’s far-away heart was stirred.
No Scotchman is insensible to gallantry. And courage is
the only thing a “canny” Scot can bear to see expanded
without return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John Broom,” screamed Miss Betty, “come down! I
order, I command you to come down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farm-bailiff drew his speckled hat forward to shade
his upward gaze, and folded his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dinna call on him, leddies,” he said, speaking more
quickly than usual. “Dinna mak him turn his head.
Steady, lad! Grip wi’ your feet. Spit on your pawms,
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the boy trod on a rotten branch, and as he drew
back his foot, and it came crashing down, the farm-bailiff set
his teeth, and Miss Kitty fainted in Thomasina’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll reward anyone who’ll fetch him down,” sobbed Miss
Betty. But John Broom seated himself on the same branch
as the cockatoo, and undid the chain and prepared his hands
for the downward journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got a rare perch, this time,” said he. And
Pretty Cocky crept towards him, and rubbed its head against
him and chuckled with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What dreams of liberty in the tree-tops, with John Broom
for a playfellow, passed through his crested head, who shall
say? But when he found that his friend meant to take him
prisoner, he became very angry and much alarmed. And
when John Broom grasped him by both legs and began to
descend, Cocky pecked him vigorously. But the boy held
the back of his head towards him, and went steadily down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weel done!” roared the farm-bailiff. “Gently lad!
Gude save us! ha’e a care o’ yoursen. That’s weel. Keep
your pow at him. Didna let the beast get at your een.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when John Broom was so near the ground as to be
safe, the farm-bailiff turned wrathfully upon his son, who had
been gazing open-mouthed at the sight which had so interested
his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye look weel standing gawping here, before the leddies,”
said he, “wasting the precious hours, and bringing your
father’s gray hairs wi’ sorrow to the grave; and John Broom
yonder shaming ye, and you not so much as thinking to
fetch the perch for him, ye lazy loon. Away wi’ ye and get
it before I lay a stick about your shoulders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when his son had gone for the perch, and John
Broom was safely on the ground, laughing, bleeding, and
triumphant, the farm-bailiff said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’re a bauld chil, John Broom, I’ll say that for ye.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>INTO THE MIST.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Unfortunately</span> the favorable impression produced by
“the gipsy lad’s” daring soon passed from the farm-bailiff’s
mind. It was partly effaced by the old jealousy of the
little ladies’ favor. Miss Betty gave the boy no less than
four silver shillings, and he ungraciously refused to let the
farm-bailiff place them in a savings bank for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matters got from bad to worse. The farming man was
not the only one who was jealous, and John Broom himself
was as idle and reckless as ever. Though, if he had listened
respectfully to the Scotchman’s counsels, or shown any disposition
to look up to and be guided by him, much might
have been overlooked. But he made fun of him and made
a friend of the cowherd. And this latter most manifest token
of low breeding vexed the respectable taste of the farm-bailiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom had his own grievances too, and he brooded
over them. He thought the little ladies had given him over
to the farm-bailiff, because they had ceased to care for him,
and that the farm-bailiff was prejudiced against him beyond
any hope of propitiation. The village folk taunted him, too,
with being an outcast, and called him Gipsy John, and this
maddened him. Then he would creep into the cowhouse and
lie in the straw against the white cow’s warm back, and for
a few of Miss Betty’s coppers, to spend in beer or tobacco,
the cowherd would hide him from the farm-bailiff and tell
him country-side tales. To Thomasina’s stories of ghosts
and gossip, he would add strange tales of smugglers on the
near-lying coast, and as John Broom listened, his restless
blood rebelled more and more against the sour sneers and
dry drudgery that he got from the farm-bailiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor were sneers the sharpest punishment his misdemeanors
earned. The farm-bailiff’s stick was thick and his arm
was strong, and he had a tendency to believe that if a flogging
was good for a boy, the more he had of it the better it
would be for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And John Broom, who never let a cry escape him at the
time would steal away afterwards and sob out his grief into
the long soft coat of the sympathizing sheep dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately he never tried the effect of deserving better
treatment as a remedy for his woes. The parson’s good
advice and Miss Betty’s entreaties were alike in vain. He
was ungrateful even to Thomasina. The little ladies sighed
and thought of the lawyer. And the parson preached
patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cocky has been tamed,” said Miss Kitty, thoughtfully,
“perhaps John Broom will get steadier by-and-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems a pity we can’t chain him to a perch, Miss
Kitty,” laughed the parson; “he would be safe then, at any
rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty said afterwards that it did seem so remarkable
that the parson should have made this particular joke on this
particular night—the night when John Broom did not come
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had played truant all day. The farm-bailiff had
wanted him, and he had kept out of the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind was from the east, and a white mist rolled in
from the sea, bringing a strange invigorating smell, and
making your lips clammy with salt. It made John Broom’s
heart beat faster, and filled his head with dreams of ships
and smugglers; and rocking masts higher than the willow tree,
and winds wilder than this wind, and dancing waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then something loomed through the fog. It was the
farm-bailiff’s speckled hat. John Broom hesitated—the
thick stick became visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a cloud rolled between them, and the child turned,
and ran, and ran, and ran, coastwards, into the sea mist.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SEA.—THE ONE-EYED SAILOR.—THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>John Broom</span> was footsore when he reached the coast,
but that keen, life-giving smell had drawn him on and held
him up. The fog had cleared off, and he strained his black
eyes through the darkness to see the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never seen it—that other world within this, on
which one lived out of doors, and climbed about all day, and
no one blamed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he did see it, he thought he had got to the end of
the world. If the edge of the cliff were not the end, he could
not make out where the sky began; and if that darkness
were the sea, the sea was full of stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was because the sea was quiet and reflected the
color of the night sky, and the stars were the lights of the
herring-boats twinkling in the bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he got down by the water he saw the vessels lying
alongside, and they were dirtier than he had supposed.
But he did not lose heart, and remembering, from the cowherd’s
tales, that people who cannot pay for their passage
must either work it out or hide themselves on board ship, he
took the easier alternative, and got on to the first vessel
which had a plank to the quay, and hid himself under some
tarpaulin on the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vessel was a collier bound for London, and she sailed
with the morning tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was found out he was not ill-treated. Indeed,
the rough skipper offered to take him home again on his return
voyage. He would have liked to go, but pride withheld
him, and home sickness had not yet eaten into his very soul.
Then an old sailor with one eye (but that a sly one) met
him, and told him tales more wonderful than the cowherd’s.
And with him he shipped as cabin-boy, on a vessel bound for
the other side of the world.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great many sins bring their own punishment in this life
pretty clearly, and sometimes pretty closely; but few more
directly or more bitterly than rebellion against the duties,
and ingratitude for the blessings, of home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no playing truant on board ship; and as to the
master poor John Broom served now, his cruelty made the
memory of the farm-bailiff a memory of tenderness and gentleness
and indulgence. Till he was half-naked and half-starved,
and had only short snatches of sleep in hard corners,
it had never occurred to him that when one has got
good food and clothes, and sound sleep in a kindly home, he
has got more than many people, and enough to be thankful
for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did everything he was told now as fast as he could do
it, in fear for his life. The one-eyed sailor had told him
that the captain always took orphans and poor friendless
lads to be his cabin-boys, and John Broom thought what a
nice kind man he must be, and how different from the farm-bailiff,
who thought nobody could be trustworthy unless he
could show parents and grandparents, and cousins to the
sixth degree. But after they had sailed, when John Broom
felt very ill, and asked the one-eyed sailor where he was to
sleep, the one-eyed sailor pleasantly replied that if he hadn’t
brought a four-post bed in his pocket he must sleep where
he could, for that all the other cabin-boys were sleeping in
Davy’s Locker, and couldn’t be disturbed. And it was not
till John Broom had learned ship’s language that he found
out that Davy’s Locker meant the deep, and that the other
cabin-boys were dead. “And as they’d nobody belonging
to ’em, no hearts was broke,” added the sailor, winking with
his one eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom slept standing sometimes for weariness, but he
did not sleep in Davy’s Locker. Young as he was he had
dauntless courage, a careless hopeful heart, and a tough little
body; and that strong, life-giving sea smell bore him up
instead of food, and he got to the other side of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why he did not stay there, why he did not run away into
the wilderness to find at least some easier death than to have
his bones broken by the cruel captain, he often wondered
afterwards. He was so much quicker and braver than the
boys they commonly got, that the old sailor kept a sharp
watch over him with his one eye whilst they were ashore;
but one day he was too drunk to see out of it, and John
Broom ran away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Christmas day, and so hot that he could not run
far, for it was at the other side of the world, where things
are upside down, and he sat down by the roadside on the
outskirts of the city; and as he sat, with his thin, brown
face resting on his hands, a familiar voice beside him said,
“Pretty Cocky!” and looking up he saw a man with several
cages of birds. The speaker was a cockatoo of the most
exquisite shades of cream-color, salmon, and rose, and he
had a rose-colored crest. But lovely as he was, John
Broom’s eyes were on another cage, where, silent, solemn
and sulky, sat a big white one with sulphur-colored trimmings
and fierce black eyes; and he was so like Miss Betty’s
pet, that the poor child’s heart bounded as if a hand had
been held out to him from home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you let him get at you, you’ll not do it a second time,
mate,” said the man. “He’s the nastiest-tempered beast I
ever saw. I’d have wrung his neck long ago if he hadn’t
such a fine coat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But John Broom said as he had said before, “I like him,
and he’ll like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the cockatoo bit his finger to the bone, the man
roared with laughter, but John Broom did not draw his hand
away. He kept it still at the bird’s beak, and with the
other he gently scratched him under the crest and wings.
And when the white cockatoo began to stretch out his eight
long toes, as cats clutch with their claws from pleasure, and
chuckled, and sighed, and bit softly without hurting, and
laid his head against the bars till his snow and sulphur
feathers touched John Broom’s black locks, the man was
amazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, mate,” said he, “you’ve the trick with birds,
and no mistake. I’ll sell you this one cheap, and you’ll be
able to sell him dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve not a penny in the world,” said John Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do look cleaned out, too,” said the man scanning
him from head to foot. “I tell you what, you shall come
with me a bit and tame the birds, and I’ll find you something
to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes before, John Broom would have jumped at
this offer, though he now refused it. The sight of the cockatoo
had brought back the fever of home sickness in all its
fierceness. He couldn’t stay out here. He would dare anything,
do anything, to see the hills about Lingborough once
more before he died; and even if he did not live to see them,
he might live to sleep in that part of Davy’s Locker which
should rock him on the shores of home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man gave him a shilling for fastening a ring and
chain on to the cocky’s ankle, and with this he got the best
dinner he had eaten since he lost sight of the farm-bailiff’s
speckled hat in the mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he went back to the one-eyed sailor, and shipped
as cabin-boy again for the homeward voyage.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE HIGHLANDER.—BARRACK LIFE.—THE GREAT CURSE—JOHN BROOM’S MONEY-BOX.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> John Broom did get home he did not go to sea
again. He lived from hand to mouth in the seaport town,
and slept, as he was well accustomed to sleep, in holes and
corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every day and every night, through the long months of
the voyage, he had dreamed of begging his way barefoot
to Miss Betty’s door. But now he did not go. His
life was hard, but it was not cruel. He was very idle,
and there was plenty to see. He wandered about the country
as of old. The ships and shipping too had a fascination
for him now that the past was past, and here he could
watch them from the shore; and, partly for shame and
partly for pride, he could not face the idea of going back.
If he had been taunted with being a vagrant boy before,
what would be said now if he presented himself, a true
tramp, to the farm-bailiff? Besides, Miss Betty and Miss
Kitty could not forgive him. It was impossible!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was wandering about one day when he came to some
fine high walls with buildings inside. There was an open
gateway, at which stood a soldier with a musket. But a
woman and some children went in, and he did not shoot
them; so when his back was turned, and he was walking
stiffly to where he came from, John Broom ran in through
the gateway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first man he saw was the grandest-looking man he
had ever seen. Indeed, he looked more like a bird than a
man, a big bird, with a big black crest. He was very tall.
His feet were broad and white, like the feathered feet of
some plumy bird; his legs were bare and brown and hairy.
He was clothed in many colors. He had fur in front,
which swung as he walked, and silver and shining stones
about him. He held his head very high, and from it
dropped great black plumes. His face looked as if it had
been cut—roughly but artistically—out of a block of old
wood, and his eyes were the color of a summer sky. And
John Broom felt as he had felt when he first saw Miss
Betty’s cockatoo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In repose the Highlander’s eye was as clear as a cairngorm
and as cold, but when it fell upon John Broom it
took a twinkle not quite unlike the twinkle in the one
eye of the sailor; and then, to his amazement, this
grand creature beckoned to John Broom with a rather
dirty hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said John Broom, staring up at the splendid
giant, with eyes of wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m saying,” said the Highlander, confidentially (and it
had a pleasant homely sound to hear him speak like the
farm-bailiff)—“I’m saying, I’m confined to barracks, ye
ken; and I’ll gi’e ye a hawpenny if ye’ll get the bottle
filled wi’ whusky. Roun’ yon corner ye’ll see the ‘Britain’s
Defenders.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this moment he erected himself, his turquoise eyes
looked straight before them, and he put his hand to his head
and moved it slowly away again, as a young man with more
swinging grandeur of colors and fur and plumes, and with
greater glittering of gems and silver, passed by, a sword
clattering after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile John Broom had been round the corner and
was back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for are ye standin’ there ye fule?” asked his new
friend. “What for didna ye gang for the whusky?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s here, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My certy, ye dinna let the grass grow under your feet,”
said the Highlander; and he added, “If ye want to run errands,
laddie, ye can come back again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the beginning of a fresh life for John Broom.
With many other idle or homeless boys he now haunted the
barracks, and ran errands for the soldiers. His fleetness of
foot and ready wit made him the favorite. Perhaps, too, his
youth and his bright face and eyes pleaded for him, for British
soldiers are a tender-hearted race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was knocked about, but never cruelly, and he got
plenty of coppers and broken victuals, and now and then an
old cap or a pair of a boots, a world too large for him. His
principal errands were to fetch liquor for the soldiers. In
arms and pockets he would sometimes carry a dozen bottles
at once, and fly back from the canteen or public-house without
breaking one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the summer was over he was familiar with every
barrack-room and guard-room in the place; he had food to
eat and coppers to spare, and he shared his bits with the
mongrel dogs who lived, as he did, on the good-nature of
the garrison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be confessed that neatness was not among John
Broom’s virtues. He looped his rags together with bits of
string, and wasted his pence or lost them. The soldiers
standing at the bar would often give him a drink out of their
pewter-pots. It choked him at first, and then he got used
to it, and liked it. Some relics of Miss Betty’s teaching
kept him honest. He would not condescend to sip by the
way out of the soldiers’ jugs and bottles as other errand-boys
did, but he came to feel rather proud of laying his twopence
on the counter, and emptying his own pot of beer with a
grimace to the by-standers through the glass at the bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day he was winking through the froth of a pint of
porter at the canteen sergeant’s daughter, who was in fits of
laughing, when the pewter was knocked out of his grasp,
and the big Highlander’s hand was laid on his shoulder and
bore him twenty or thirty yards from the place in one
swoop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll trouble ye to give me your attention,” said the
Highlander, when they came to a standstill, “and to speak
the truth. Did ye ever see me the worse of liquor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom had several remembrances of the clearest
kind to that effect, so he put up his arms to shield his head
from the probable blow, and said, “Yes, McAlister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How often?” asked the Scotchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never counted,” said John Broom; “pretty often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many good-conduct stripes do ye ken me to have
lost of your ain knowledge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three, McAlister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a finer man than me in the regiment?” asked
the Highlander, drawing up his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That there’s not,” said John Broom, warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our sairgent, now,” drawled the Scotchman, “wad ye
say he was a better man than me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing like so good,” said John Broom, sincerely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what d’ye suppose, man,” said the Highlander, firing
with sudden passion, till the light of his clear blue eyes
seemed to pierce John Broom’s very soul—“what d’ye suppose
has hindered me that I’m not sairgent, when yon man
is? What has keepit me from being an officer, that has
served my country in twa battles when oor quartermaster
hadn’t enlisted? Wha gets my money? What lost me my
stripes? What loses me decent folks’ respect, and waur
than that, my ain? What gars a hand that can grip a
broadsword tremble like a woman’s? What fills the canteen
and the kirkyard? What robs a man of health and wealth
and peace? What ruins weans and women, and makes mair
homes desolate than war? Drink, man, drink! The deevil
of drink!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not till the glare in his eyes had paled that John
Broom ventured to speak. Then he said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t ye give it up, McAlister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man rose to his full height, and laid his hand heavily
on the boy’s shoulder, and his eyes seemed to fade with that
pitiful, weary look, which only such blue eyes show so well,
“Because I <span class='it'>canna</span>,” said he; “because, for as big as I am,
I canna. But for as little as you are, laddie, ye can, and,
Heaven help me, ye shall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening he called John Broom into the barrack-room
where he slept. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, and
had a little wooden money-box in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What money have ye, laddie?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom pulled out three halfpence lately earned, and
the Scotchman dropped them slowly into the box. Then he
turned the key, and put it into his pocket, and gave the box
to the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’ll put what you earn in there,” said he, “I’ll keep
the key, and ye’ll keep the box yourself; and when its
opened we’ll open it together, and lay out your savings in
decent clothes for ye against the winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment some men passing to the canteen shouted,
“McAlister!” The Highlander did not answer, but he
started to the door. Then he stood irresolute, and then
turned and reseated himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gang and bring me a bit o’ tobacco,” he said, giving
John Broom a penny. And when the boy had gone he emptied
his pocket of the few pence left, and dropped them into
the box, muttering, “If he manna, I wunna.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the tobacco came, he lit his pipe, and sat on
the bench, outside and snarled at every one who spoke to
him.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>OUTPOST DUTY.—THE SERGEANT’S STORY.—GRAND ROUNDS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a bitterly cold winter. The soldiers drank a great
deal, and John Broom was constantly trotting up and down,
and the box grew very heavy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bottles were filled and refilled, in spite of greatly increased
strictness in the discipline of the garrison, for there
were rumors of invasion, and penalties were heavy, and sentry
posts were increased, and the regiments were kept in
readiness for action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Highlander had not cured himself of drinking, though
he had cured John Broom. But, like others, he was more
wary just now, and had hitherto escaped the heavy punishments
inflicted in a time of probable war; and John Broom
watched over him with the fidelity of a sheep dog, and more
than once had roused him with a can of cold water when he
was all but caught by his superiors in a state of stupor,
which would not have been credited to the frost alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk of invasion had become grave, when one day a
body of men were ordered for outpost duty, and McAlister
was among them. The officer had got a room for them in a
farmhouse, where they sat round the fire, and went out by
turns to act as sentries at various posts for an hour or two
at a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The novelty was delightful to John Broom. He hung
about the farmhouse, and warmed himself at the soldiers’
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the day McAlister got him apart, and
whispered, “I’m going on duty the night at ten, laddie.
It’s fearsome cold, and I hav’na had a drop to warm me the
day. If ye could ha’ brought me a wee drappie to the corner
of the three roads—its twa miles from here I’m thinking—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not the miles, McAlister,” said John Broom, “but
you’re on outpost duty, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re misdoubting what may be done to ye for
bringing liquor to a sentry on duty! Aye, aye, lad, ye do
weel to be cautious,” said the Highlander, and he turned
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not the fear of consequences to himself which
had made John Broom hesitate, and he was stung by the
implication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was dark and very cold, and the Highlander
had been pacing up and down his post for about half an hour,
when his quick ear caught a faint sound of footsteps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wha goes there?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s I, McAlister,” whispered John Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whisht, laddie,” said the sentry; “are ye there after
all? Did no one see ye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a soul; I crept by the hedges. Here’s your whisky,
McAlister; but, oh, be careful!” said the lad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scotchman’s eye glistened greedily at the bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never fear,” said he, “I’ll just rub a wee drappie on the
pawms of my hands to keep away the frost-bite, for it’s
awsome cold, man. Now away wi’ ye, and take tent, laddie,
keep off the other sentries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom went back as carefully as he had come, and
slipped in to warm himself by the guard-room fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a good one, and the soldiers sat close round it.
The officer was writing a letter in another room, and in a
low, impressive voice, the sergeant was telling a story which
was listened to with breathless attention. John Broom
was fond of stories, and he listened also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was of a friend of the sergeant’s, who had been a boy
with him in the same village at home, who had seen active
service with him abroad, and who had slept at his post on
such a night as this, from the joint effects of cold and drink.
It was war time, and he had been tried by court-martial,
and shot for the offense. The sergeant had been one of the
firing party to execute his friend, and they had taken leave
of each other as brothers, before the final parting face to
face in this last awful scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s voice was faltering, when the tale was cut
short by the jingling of the field officer’s accoutrements as
he rode by to visit the outposts. In an instant the officer
and men turned out to receive him; and, after the usual
formalities, he rode on. The officer went back to his letter,
and the sergeant and his men to their fireside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opening of the doors had let in a fresh volume of
cold, and one of the men called to John Broom to mend the
fire. But he was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom was fleet of foot, and there are certain moments
which lift men beyond their natural powers, but he
had set himself a hard task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he listened to the sergeant’s tale, an agonizing fear
smote him for his friend McAlister. Was there any hope
that the Highlander could keep himself from the whisky?
Officers were making their rounds at very short intervals just
now, and if drink and cold overcame him at his post!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close upon these thoughts came the jingling of the field
officer’s sword, and the turn out of the guard. “Who goes
there?”—“Rounds.”—“What rounds?”—“Grand
rounds?”—“Halt, grand rounds, advance one, and give
the countersign!” The familiar words struck coldly on
John Broom’s heart, as if they had been orders to a firing
party, and the bandage were already across the Highlander’s
blue eyes. Would the grand rounds be challenged at the
three roads to-night? He darted out into the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flew, as the crow flies, across the fields, to where McAlister
was on duty. It was a much shorter distance than
by the road, which was winding; but whether this would
balance the difference between a horse’s pace and his own
was the question, and there being no time to question, he
ran on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept his black head down, and ran from his shoulders.
The clatter, clatter, jingle, jingle, on the hard road came to
him through the still frost on a level with his left ear. It
was terrible, but he held on, dodging under the hedges to be
out of sight, and the sound lessened, and by-and-by, the
road having wound about, he could hear it faintly, <span class='it'>but
behind him</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he reached the three roads, and McAlister was
asleep in the ditch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when, with jingle and clatter, the field officer of the
day reached the spot, the giant Highlander stood like a
watch-tower at his post, with a little snow on the black
plumes that drooped upon his shoulders.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HOSPITAL.—“HAME.”</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>John Broom</span> did not see the Highlander again for two or
three days. It was Christmas week, and, in spite of the
war panic, there was festivity enough in the barracks to keep
the errand-boy very busy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came New Year’s Eve—“Hogmenay,” as the
Scotch call it—and it was the Highland regiment’s particular
festival. Worn-out with whisky-fetching and with helping to
deck barrack-rooms and carrying pots and trestles, John
Broom was having a nap in the evening, in company with a
mongrel deerhound, when a man shook him, and said, “I
heard some one asking for ye an hour or two back; McAlister
wants ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?” said John Broom, jumping to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In hospital; he’s been there a day or two. He got cold
on out-post duty, and it’s flown to his lungs, they say. Ye
see he’s been a hard drinker, has McAlister, and I expect
he’s breaking up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With which very just conclusion the speaker went on into
the canteen, and John Broom ran to the hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stripped of his picturesque trappings, and with no plumes
to shadow the hollows in his temples, McAlister looked gaunt
and feeble enough, as he lay in the little hospital bed, which
barely held his long limbs. Such a wreck of giant powers
of body, and noble qualities of mind as the drink-shops are
preparing for the hospitals every day!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the quickly-reached medical decision that he was in
a rapid decline, and that nothing could be done for him,
McAlister had been left a good deal alone. His intellect
(and it was no fool’s intellect,) was quite clear, and if the
long hours by himself, in which he reckoned with his own
soul, had hastened the death-damps on his brow, they had
also written there an expression which was new to John
Broom. It was not the old sour look, it was a kind of
noble gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His light, blue eyes brightened as the boy came in, and
he held out his hand, and John Broom took it with both his,
saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard till this minute, McAlister. Eh, I do
hope you’ll be better soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lord being merciful to me,” said the Highlander.
“But <span class='it'>this</span> world’s nearly past, laddie, and I was fain to see
ye again. Dinna greet, man, for I’ve important business
wi’ ye, and I should wish your attention. Firstly, I’m
aboot to hand ower to ye the key of your box. Tak it, and
put it in a pocket that’s no got a hole in it, if you’re worth
one. Secondly, there’s a bit bag I made mysel, and it’s
got a trifle o’ money in it that I’m giving and bequeathing
to ye, under certain conditions, namely, that ye shall spend
the contents of the box according to my last wishes and
instructions, with the ultimate end of your ain benefit, ye’ll
understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fit of coughing here broke McAlister’s discourse; but
after drinking from a cup beside him, he put aside John
Broom’s remonstrances with a dignified movement of his
hand, and continued,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When a body comes of decent folk, he won’t just care,
maybe, to have their names brought up in a barrack-room.
Ye never heard me say aught of my father or my mither?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, McAlister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d a good hame,” said the Highlander, with a decent
pride in his tone. “It was a strict hame—I’ve no cause
now to deceive mysel’, thinking it was a wee bit ower
strict—but it was a good hame. I left it, man—I ran
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glittering blue eyes turned sharply on the lad, and
he went on:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A body doesna’ care to turn his byeganes oot for every
fool to peck at. Did I ever speer about your past life, and
whar ye came from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, McAlister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s no to say that, if I knew manners, I dinna
obsairve. And there’s been things now and again, John
Broom, that’s gar’d me think that ye’ve had what I had,
and done as I did. Did ye rin awa’, laddie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom nodded his black head, but tears choked his
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man!” said the Highlander, “ane word’s as gude’s a
thousand. Gang back! Gang hame! There’s the bit
siller here that’s to tak ye, and the love yonder that’s
waiting ye. Listen to a dying man, laddie, and gang
hame!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if they’d have me,” sobbed John Broom, “I
gave ’em a deal of trouble, McAlister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And d’ye think, lad, that that thought has na’ cursed
<span class='it'>me</span>, and keepit me from them that loved me? Aye, lad, and
till this week I never overcame it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weel may I want to save ye, bairn,” added the Highlander
tenderly, “for it was the thocht of a’ ye riskit for
the like of me at the three roads, that made me consider wi’
mysel’ that I’ve aiblins been turning my back a’ my wilfu’
life on love that’s bigger than a man’s deservings. It’s
near done now, and it’ll never lie in my poor power so much
as rightly to thank ye. It’s strange that a man should set
store by a good name that he doesna’ deserve; but if ony
blessings of mine could bring ye good, they’re yours, that
saved an old soldier’s honor, and let him die respected in
his regiment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, McAlister, let me fetch one of the chaplains to
write a letter to fetch your father,” cried John Broom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The minister’s been here this morning,” said the Highlander,
“and I’ve tell’t him mair than I’ve tell’t you. And
he’s jest directed me to put my sinful trust in the Father of
us a’. I’ve sinned heaviest against <span class='it'>Him</span>, laddie, but His
love is stronger than the lave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Broom remained by his friend, whose painful fits of
coughing, and of gasping for breath, were varied by intervals
of seeming stupor. When a candle had been brought
in and placed near the bed, the Highlander roused himself
and asked,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a Bible on yon table? Could ye read a bit
to me, laddie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is little need to dwell on the bitterness of heart
with which John Broom confessed,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t read big words, McAlister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did ye never go to school?” said the Scotchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t learn,” said the poor boy; “I played.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye. Weel, ye’ll learn, when ye gang hame,”
said the Highlander, in gentle tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never get home,” said John Broom, passionately.
“I’ll never forgive myself. I’ll never get over it, that I
couldn’t read to ye when ye wanted me, McAlister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gently, gently,” said the Scotchman. “Dinna daunt
yoursel’ owermuch wi’ the past, laddie. And for me—I’m
not that presoomptious to think that I can square up a misspent
life as a man might compound wi’s creditors. ’Gin
<span class='sc'>He</span> forgi’es me, He’ll forgi’e; but it’s not a prayer up or a
chapter down that’ll stan’ between me and the Almighty.
So dinna fret yoursel’, but let me think while I may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, far into the night, the Highlander lay silent, and
John Broom watched by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just midnight when he partly raised himself, and
cried,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whist, laddie! do ye hear the pipes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dying ears must have been quick, for John Broom
heard nothing; but in a few moments he heard the bagpipes
from the officers’ mess, where they were keeping Hogmenay.
They were playing the old year out with “Auld
lang syne,” and the Highlander beat the tune out with his
hand, and his eyes gleamed out of his rugged face in the dim
light, as cairngorms glitter in dark tartan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause after the first verse, and he grew
restless, and turning doubtfully to where John Broom sat, as
if his sight were failing, he said, “Ye’ll mind your promise,
ye’ll gang hame?” And after awhile he repeated the last
word,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hame!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he spoke there spread over his face a smile so
tender and so full of happiness, that John Broom held his
breath as he watched him. As the light of sunrise creeps
over the face of some rugged rock, it crept from chin to
brow, and the pale blue eyes shone tranquil, like water that
reflects heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when it had passed it left them still open, but gems
that had lost their ray.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LUCK GOES.—AND COMES AGAIN.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> spirit does not always falter in its faith because the
flesh is weary with hope deferred. When week after week,
month after month, and year after year, went by and John
Broom was not found, the disappointment seemed to “age”
the little ladies, as Thomasina phrased it. But yet they said
to the parson, “We do not regret it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid that you should regret it,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even the lawyer (whose heart was kinder than his
tongue) abstained from taunting them with his prophecies,
and said, “The force of the habits of early education is a
power as well as that of inherent tendencies. It is only for
your sake that I regret a too romantic benevolence.” And
Miss Betty and Miss Kitty tried to put the matter quite
away. But John Broom was very closely bound up with
the life of many years past. Thomasina mourned him as if
he had been her son, and Thomasina being an old and valuable
servant, it is needless to say that when she was miserable
no one in the house was permitted to be quite at ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to Pretty Cocky, he lived, but Miss Kitty fancied
that he grew less pretty and drooped upon his polished
perch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were times when the parson felt almost conscience-stricken
because he had encouraged the adoption of John
Broom. Disappointments fall heavily upon elderly people.
They may submit better than the young, but they do not so
easily revive. The little old ladies looked grayer and more
nervous, and the little old house looked grayer and gloomier
than of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed there were other causes of anxiety. Times were
changing, prices were rising, and the farm did not thrive.
The lawyer said that the farm-bailiff neglected his duties,
and that the cowherd did nothing but drink; but Miss Betty
trembled, and said they could not part with old servants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farm-bailiff had his own trouble, but he kept it to
himself. No one knew how severely he had beaten John
Broom the day before he ran away, but he remembered it
himself with painful clearness. Harsh men are apt to have
consciences, and his was far from easy about the lad who had
been entrusted to his care. He could not help thinking of it
when the day’s work was over, and he had to keep filling up
his evening whisky-glass again and again to drown disagreeable
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whisky answered this purpose, but it made him late
in the morning; it complicated business on market days, not
to the benefit of the farm, and it put him at a disadvantage
in dealing with the drunken cowherd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cowherd was completely upset by John Broom’s
mysterious disappearance, and he comforted himself as the
farm-bailiff did, but to a larger extent. And Thomasina
winked at many irregularities in consideration of the groans
of sympathy with which he responded to her tears as they
sat around the hearth where John Broom no longer lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time that he vanished from Lingborough the gossips
of the country side said, “This comes of making pets of
tramps’ brats, when honest folk’s sons may toil and moil
without notice.” But when it was proved that the tramp-boy
had stolen nothing, when all search for him was vain,
and when prosperity faded from the place season by season
and year by year, there were old folk who whispered that
the gaudily-clothed child Miss Betty had found under the
broom-bush had something more than common in him, and
that whoever and whatever had offended the eerie creature,
he had taken the luck of Lingborough with him when he
went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early summer. The broom was shining in the
hedges with uncommon wealth of golden blossoms. “The
lanes look for all the world as they did the year that poor
child was found,” said Thomasina, wiping her eyes. Annie
the lass sobbed hysterically, and the cowherd found himself
so low in spirits that after gazing dismally at the cow-stalls,
which had not been cleaned for days past, he betook himself
to the ale-house to refresh his energies for this and other
arrears of work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On returning to the farm, however, he found his hands
still feeble, and he took a drop or two more to steady them,
after which it occurred to him that certain new potatoes
which he had had orders to dig were yet in the ground.
The wood was not chopped for the next day’s use, and he
wondered what had become of a fork he had had in the
morning and had laid down somewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he seated himself on some straw in the corner to think
about it all, and whilst he was thinking he fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By his own account many remarkable things had befallen
him in the course of his life, including that meeting with a
Black Something to which allusion has been made, but nothing
so strange as what happened to him that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he awoke in the morning and sat up on the straw,
and looked around him, the stable was freshly cleaned, the
litter in the stalls was shaken and turned, and near the door
was an old barrel of newly-dug potatoes, and the fork stood
by it. And when he ran to the wood-house there lay the
wood neatly chopped and piled to take away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept his own counsel that day and took credit for the
work, but when on the morrow the farm-bailiff was at a loss
to know who had thinned the turnips that were left to do in
the upper field, and Annie the lass found the kitchen-cloths
she had left overnight to soak, rubbed through and rinsed,
and laid to dry, the cowherd told his tale to Thomasina, and
begged for a bowl of porridge and cream to set in the barn,
as one might set a mouse-trap baited with cheese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For,” said he, “the luck of Lingborough’s come back,
missis. <span class='it'>It’s Lob Lie-by-the-fire!</span>”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LOB LIE-BY-THE-FIRE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>It’s</span> Lob Lie-by-the-fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Thomasina whispered exultingly, and Annie the lass
timidly. Thomasina cautioned the cowherd to hold his
tongue, and she said nothing to the little ladies on the subject.
She felt certain that they would tell the parson, and
he might not approve. The farm-bailiff knew of a farm on
the Scotch side of the Border where a brownie had been
driven away by the minister preaching his last Sunday’s
sermon over again at him, and as Thomasina said, “There’d
been little enough luck at Lingborough lately, that they
should wish to scare it away when it came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet the news leaked out gently, and was soon known
all through the neighborhood—as a secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The luck of Lingborough’s come back. Lob’s lying by
the fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could be heard at his work any night, and several
people had seen him, though this vexed Thomasina, who
knew well that the Good People do not like to be watched
at their labors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cowherd had not been able to resist peeping down
through chinks in the floor of the loft above the barn,
where he slept, and one night he had seen Lob fetching straw
for the cowhouse. “A great, rough, black fellow,” said he,
and he certainly grew bigger and rougher and blacker every
time the cowherd told the tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lubber-fiend appeared next to a boy who was
loitering at a late hour somewhere near the little ladies’
kitchen-garden, and whom he pursued and pelted with
mud till the lad nearly lost his wits with terror. (It was
the same boy who was put in the lock-up in the autumn for
stealing Farmer Mangel’s Siberian crabs.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this trick, however, the rough elf atoned by leaving
three pecks of newly-gathered fruit in the kitchen the
following morning. Never had there been such a preserving
season at Lingborough within the memory of Thomasina.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth is, hobgoblins, from Puck to Will-o’-the-wisp,
are apt to play practical jokes and knock people about whom
they meet after sunset. A dozen tales of such were rife,
and folk were more amused than amazed by Lob Lie-by-the-fire’s
next prank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an aged pauper who lived on the charity of the
little ladies, and whom it was Miss Betty’s practice to employ
to do light weeding in the fields for heavy wages.
This venerable person was toddling to his home in the
gloaming with a barrow-load of Miss Betty’s new potatoes,
dexterously hidden by an upper sprinkling of groundsel and
hemlock, when the Lubber-fiend sprang out from behind an
elder-bush, ran at the old man with his black head, and
knocked him, heels uppermost into the ditch. The wheel-barrow
was afterwards found in Miss Betty’s farmyard, quite
empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the cowherd (who had his own opinion of the
aged pauper, and it was a very poor one) went that evening,
to drink Lob Lie-by-the-fire’s health from a bottle he kept in
the harness-room window, he was nearly choked with the
contents, which had turned into salt and water, as fairy jewels
turn to withered leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But luck had come to Lingborough. There had not been
such crops for twice seven years past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lay-away hen’s eggs were brought regularly to the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ducklings were not eaten by rats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No fowls were stolen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tub of pig-meal lasted three times as long as
usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cart-wheels and gate-hinges were oiled by unseen
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mushrooms in the croft gathered themselves and lay
down on a dish in the larder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is by small savings that a farm thrives, and Miss Betty’s
farm throve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody worked with more alacrity. Annie, the lass,
said the butter came in a way that made it a pleasure to
churn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighbors knew even more than those on the spot.
They said—That since Lob came back to Lingborough the
hens laid eggs as large as turkeys’ eggs, and the turkeys’
eggs were—oh, you wouldn’t believe the size!</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the cows gave nothing but cream, and that Thomasina
skimmed butter off it as less lucky folk skim cream from
milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That her cheeses were as rich as butter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That she sold all she made, for Lob took the fairy butter
from the old trees in the avenue, and made it up into pats
for Miss Betty’s table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That if you bought Lingborough turnips, you might feed
your cows on them all the winter and the milk would be as
sweet as new-mown hay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That horses foddered on Lingborough hay would have
thrice the strength of others, and that sheep who cropped
Lingborough pastures would grow three times as fat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That for as good a watch-dog as it was the sheep dog
never barked at Lob, a plain proof that he was more than
human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That for all its good luck it was not safe to loiter near
the place after dark, if you wished to keep your senses.
And if you took so much as a fallen apple belonging to
Miss Betty, you might look out for palsy or St. Vitus’s
dance, or to be carried off bodily to the underground folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, that it was well that all the cows gave double,
for that Lob Lie-by-the-fire drank two gallons of the best
cream every day, with curds, porridge, and other dainties to
match. But what did that matter, when he had been overheard
to swear that luck should not leave Lingborough till
Miss Betty owned half the country side?</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>MISS BETTY IS SURPRISED.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Miss Betty</span> and Miss Kitty having accepted a polite
invitation from Mrs. General Dunmaw, went down to
tea with that lady one fine evening in this eventful summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Death had made a gap or two in the familiar circle
during the last fourteen years, but otherwise it was quite
the same except that the lawyer was married and not quite
so sarcastic, and that Mrs. Brown Jasey had brought a
young niece with her dressed in the latest fashion, which
looked quite as odd as new fashions are wont to do, and
with a <span class='it'>coiffure</span> “enough to frighten the French away,” as
her aunt told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was while this young lady was getting more noise out
of Mrs. Dunmaw’s red silk and rosewood piano than had
been shaken out of it during the last thirty years, that the
lawyer brought his cup of coffee to Miss Betty’s side, and
said, suavely, “I hear wonderful accounts of Lingborough,
dear Miss Betty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thankful to say, sir, that the farm is doing well
this year. I am very thankful, for the past few years have
been unfavorable, and we had begun to face the fact that it
might be necessary to sell the old place. And, I will not deny,
sir, that it would have gone far to break my heart, to say
nothing of my sister Kitty’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we shouldn’t have let it come to that,” said the
lawyer, “I could have raised a loan——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said Miss Betty, with dignity; “If we have our
own pride, I hope it’s an honest one. Lingborough will
have passed out of our family when it’s kept up on borrowed
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>could</span> live in lodgings,” added Miss Betty, firmly,
“little as I’ve been accustomed to it, but <span class='it'>not in debt</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, my dear madam, we needn’t talk about it
now. But I’m dying of curiosity as to the mainstay of all
this good luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The turnips—” began Miss Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless my soul, Miss Betty!” cried the lawyer, “I’m
not talking turnips. I’m talking of Lob Lie-by-the-fire, as
all the country side is for that matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country people have plenty of tales of him,” said
Miss Betty, with some pride in the family goblin. “He
used to haunt the old barns, they say, in my great-grandfather’s
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now you’ve got him back again,” said the lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I know of,” said Miss Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On which the lawyer poured into her astonished ear all
the latest news on the subject, and if it had lost nothing before
reaching his house in the town, it rather gained in
marvels as he repeated it to Miss Betty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wonder that the little lady was anxious to get home to
question Thomasina, and that somewhat before the usual
hour she said.—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister Kitty, if it’s not too soon for the servant——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the parson, threading his way to where Mrs. Dunmaw’s
china crape shawl (dyed crimson) shone in the bow
window, said, “The clergy should keep respectable hours;
especially when they are as old as I am. Will you allow me
to thank you for a very pleasant evening, and to say good-night?”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE PARSON AND THE LUBBER-FIEND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Do</span> you think there’d be any harm in leaving it alone,
sister Betty?” asked Miss Kitty, tremulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached Lingborough, and the parson had come
in with them, by Miss Betty’s request, and Thomasina had
been duly examined:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh, Miss Betty, why should ye chase away good luck
with the minister?” cried she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister Kitty! Thomasina!” said Miss Betty. “I would
not accept good luck from a doubtful quarter to save Lingborough.
But if It can face this excellent clergyman, the
Being who haunted my great-grandfather’s farm is still welcome
to the old barns, and you, Thomasina, need not grudge
It cream or curds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re quite right, sister Betty,” said Miss Kitty, “you
always are; but oh dear, oh dear!”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thomasina tells me,” said Miss Betty, turning to the
parson, “that on chilly evenings It sometimes comes and lies
by the kitchen fire after they have gone to bed, and I can
distinctly remember my grandmother mentioning the same
thing. Thomasina has of late left the kitchen door on the
latch for Its convenience, as they had to sit up late for us,
she and Annie have taken their work into the still-room to
leave the kitchen free for Lob Lie-by-the-fire. They have not
looked into the kitchen this evening, as such beings do not
like to be watched. But they fancy that they heard It come
in. I trust, sir, that neither in myself nor my sister Kitty
does timidity exceed a proper feminine sensibility, where
duty is concerned. If you will be good enough to precede
us, we will go to meet the old friend of my great-grandfather’s
fortunes, and we leave it entirely to your valuable
discretion to pursue what course you think proper on the
occasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the door?” said the parson, cheerfully, after
knocking his head against black beams and just saving his
legs down shallow and unexpected steps on his way to the
kitchen—beams so unfelt and steps so familiar to the women
that it had never struck them that the long passage was not
the most straightforward walk a man could take—“I think
you said It generally lies on the hearth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happy thought struck Thomasina that the parson
might be frightened out of his unlucky interference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, sir,” said she from behind. “We’ve heard
him rolling by the fire, and growling like thunder to himself.
They say he’s an awful size, too, with the strength of four
men, and a long tail, and eyes like coals of fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Thomasina spoke in vain, for the parson opened the
door, and as they pressed in, the moonlight streaming
through the lattice window showed Lob lying by the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s his tail! Ay——k!” screeched Annie the lass,
and away she went, without drawing breath, to the top garret,
where she locked and bolted herself in, and sat her
bandbox flat, screaming for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was the plumy tail of the sheep dog, who was
lying there with the Lubber-fiend. And Lob was asleep,
with his arms round the sheep dog’s neck, and the sheep
dog’s head lay on his breast, and his own head touched the
dog’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was a smaller head than the parson had been led
to expect, and it had thick black hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the parson bent over the hearth, Thomasina took Miss
Kitty round the waist, and Miss Betty clutched her black
velvet bag till the steel beads ran into her hands, and they
were quite prepared for an explosion, and sulphur, and blue
lights, and thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the parson’s deep round voice broke the silence,
saying,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, lad? God bless you, John Broom. You’re
welcome home!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE END.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Some</span> things—such as gossip—gain in the telling, but
there are others before which words fail, though each heart
knows its own power of sympathy. And such was the joy
of the little ladies and of Thomasina at John Broom’s return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheep dog had his satisfaction out long ago, and had
kept it to himself, but how Pretty Cocky crowed, and
chuckled, and danced, and bowed his crest, and covered his
face with his amber wings, and kicked his seed-pot over, and
spilt his water-pot on to the Derbyshire marble chess-table,
and screamed till the room rang again, and went on screaming,
with Miss Kitty’s pocket-handkerchief over his head to
keep him quiet, my poor pen can but imperfectly describe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desire to atone for the past which had led John
Broom to act the part of one of those Good-Fellows who
have, we must fear, finally deserted us, will be easily understood.
And to a nature of his type, the earning of some
self-respect, and of a new character before others, was perhaps
a necessary prelude to future well-doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did do well. He became “a good scholar,” as farmers
were then. He spent as much of his passionate energies on
the farm as the farm would absorb, and he restrained the
rest. It is not cockatoos only who have sometimes to live
and be happy in this unfinished life with one wing clipped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fine weather, when the perch was put into the garden,
Miss Betty was sometimes startled by stumbling on John
Broom in the dusk, sitting on his heels, the unfastened chain
in his hand, with his black head lovingly laid against Cocky’s
white and yellow poll, talking in a low voice, and apparently
with the sympathy of his companion; and, as Miss Betty
justly feared, of that “other side of the world,” which they
both knew, and which both at times had cravings to revisit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even after the sobering influences of middle age had
touched him, and a wife and children bound him with the
quiet ties of home, he had (at long intervals) his “restless
times,” when his good “missis” would bring out a little
store laid by in one of the children’s socks, and would bid
him “Be off, and get a breath of the sea-air,” but on condition
that the sock went with him as his purse. John Broom
always looked ashamed to go, but he came back the
better, and his wife was quite easy in his absence with that
confidence in her knowledge of “the master,” which is so
mysterious to the unmarried, and which Miss Betty looked
upon as “want of feeling” to the end. She always dreaded
that he would not return, and a little ruse which she adopted
of giving him money to make bargains for foreign articles
of <span class='it'>vertu</span> with the sailors, is responsible for many of the
choicest ornaments in the Lingborough parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sock’ll bring him home,” said Mrs. Broom, and
home he came, and never could say what he had been doing.
Nor was the account given by Thomasina’s cousin, who was
a tide-waiter down yonder, particularly satisfying to the
women’s curiosity. He said that John Broom was always
about; that he went aboard of all the craft in the bay, and
asked whence they came and whither they were bound.
That, being once taunted to it, he went up the rigging of a
big vessel like a cat, and came down it looking like a fool.
That, as a rule, he gossipped and shared his tobacco with
sailors and fishermen, and brought out the sock much oftener
than was prudent for the benefit of the ragged boys who
haunt the quay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had two other weaknesses, which a faithful biographer
must chronicle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A regiment on the march would draw him from the
ploughtail itself, and “With daddy to see the soldiers” was
held to excuse any of Mrs. Broom’s children from household
duties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other shall be described in the graphic language of
that acute observer the farm-bailiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there cam’ an Irish beggar, wi’ a stripy cloot roond
him and a bellows under’s arm, and ca’d himself a Hielander,
the lad wad gi’e him his silly head off his shoulders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the farm-bailiff, perhaps no one felt more or said
less than he did on John Broom’s return. But the tones
of his voice had tender associations for the boy’s ears as he
took off his speckled hat, and after contemplating the inside
for some moments, put it on again, and said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aweel, lad, sae ye’ve cam hame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he listened with quivering face when John Broom
told the story of McAlister, and when it was ended he rose
and went out, and “took the pledge” against drink, and—kept
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moved by similar enthusiasm, the cowherd took the
pledge also, and if he didn’t keep it, he certainly drank less,
chiefly owing to the vigilant oversight of the farm-bailiff,
who now exercised his natural severity almost exclusively in
the denunciation of all liquors whatsoever, from the cowherd’s
whisky to Thomasina’s elder-flower wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plain cousin left his money to the little old ladies, and
Lingborough continued to flourish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly perhaps because of this, it is doubtful if John
Broom was ever looked upon by the rustics as quite “like
other folk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The favorite version of his history is that he was Lob
under the guise of a child; that he was driven away by new
clothes; that he returned from unwillingness to see an old
family go to ruin “which he had served for hundreds of
years;” that the parson preached his last Sunday’s sermon
at him; and that having stood that test, he took his place
among Christian people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether a name invented off-hand, however plain and
sensible, does not stick to a man as his father’s does, is
a question. But John Broom was not often called by
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Scotch caution, the farm-bailiff seldom exceeded
the safe title of “Man!” and the parson was apt to address
him as “My dear boy” when he had certainly outgrown the
designation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Betty called him John Broom, but the people called
him by the name that he had earned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And long after his black hair lay white and thick on his
head, like snow on the old barn roof, and when his dark eyes
were dim in an honored old age, the village children would
point him out to each other, crying, “There goes Lob Lie-by-the-fire,
the Luck of Lingborough!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span><h1>TIMOTHY’S SHOES.</h1></div>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE FAIRY GODMOTHER.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Timothy’s</span> mother was very conscientious. When she
was quite a young woman, just after the birth of her first
baby, and long before Timothy saw the light, she was very
much troubled about the responsibilities of having a family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose,” she murmured, “they catch measles, whooping
cough, chicken-pox, scarlatina, croup, or inflammation
of the lungs, when I might have prevented it; and either
die, or have weak eyes, weak lungs or a chronic sore throat
to the end of their days. Suppose they have bandy legs
from walking too soon, or crooked spines from being carried
too long. Suppose, too, that they grow up bad—that they
go wrong, do what one will to keep them right. Suppose I
cannot afford to educate them properly, or that they won’t
learn if I can afford to have them taught. Suppose that
they die young, when I might have kept them alive; or live
only to make me think they had better have died young.
Oh dear, it’s a terrible responsibility having a family!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too late to talk about that now, my dear,” said her
godmother (a fairy godmother, too!); “the baby is a very fine
boy, and if you will let me know when the christening-day
is fixed, I will come and give him a present. I can’t be
godmother, though; I’m too old, and you’ve talked about
responsibilities till I’m quite alarmed.” With which the old
lady kissed her goddaughter, and nearly put out the baby’s
eye with the point of her peaked hat, after which she
mounted her broomstick and rode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very fine boy,” continued the young mother. “Ah!
that’s just where it is; if it had only been a girl I shouldn’t
have felt so much afraid. Girls are easily managed. They
have got consciences, and they mend their own clothes.
You can make them work, and they can amuse themselves
when they’re not working. Now with boys it is quite
different. And yet I shouldn’t wonder if I have a large
family of boys, just because I feel it to be such a responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was quite right. Years went by; one baby after
another was added to the family, and they were all boys.
“Twenty feet that want socks,” sighed the good woman,
“and not a hand that can knit or darn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we must go back to the first christening. The godmother
arrived, dressed in plum-colored satin, with a small
brown-paper parcel in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortunatus’s purse!” whispered one of the guests,
nudging his neighbor with his elbow. “The dear child will
always be welcome in my poor establishment,” he added
aloud to the mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mere trifle, my love,” said the fairy godmother, laying
the brown-paper parcel beside her on the table and nodding
kindly to her goddaughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That means a mug,” said one of the godfathers, decidedly.
“Rather shabby! I’ve gone as far as a knife,
fork, and spoon myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless ’tis of the more precious metal,” said Dr.
Dixon Airey, the schoolmaster (and this was his way of
saying that it was a gold mug), “and not improbably studded
with the glittering diamond. Let us not be precipitate
in our conclusions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the fairy spoke again. “My dear goddaughter,”
she began, laying her hand upon the parcel, “I
have too often had reason to observe that the gift of beauty
is far from invariably proving a benefit to its possessor.”
(“I told you it was a purse,” muttered the guest.)
“Riches,” continued the fairy, “are hardly a less doubtful
boon; and the youth who is born to almost unlimited
wealth is not always slow to become a bankrupt. Indeed,
I fear that the experience of many centuries has almost
convinced us poor fairies that extraordinary gifts are not
necessarily blessings. This trifle,” she continued, beginning
to untie the string of the parcel, “is a very common gift to
come from my hands, but I trust it will prove useful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” cried the godfather, “didn’t I say it was a
mug? Common? Why there’s nothing so universal except,
indeed, the knife, fork, and spoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before he had finished his sentence the parcel was
opened, and the fairy presented the young mother with—<span class='it'>a
small pair of strong leather shoes, copper tipped and heeled</span>.
“They’ll never wear out, my dear,” she said; “rely upon
it, you’ll find them a ‘mother’s blessing,’ and however
large a family you may have, your children will step into
one another’s shoes just at the age when little feet are the
most destructive.” With which the old lady carefully
wound the string on her finger into a neat twist, and folding
the bit of brown paper put both in her pocket, for she was a
very economical dame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will not attempt to describe the scandalized buzz in
which the visitors expressed their astonishment at the meanness
of the fairy’s gift. As for the young mother, she was
a sensible, sweet-tempered woman, and very fond of her old
godmother, so she set it down to a freak of eccentricity;
and, dismissing a few ambitious day-dreams from her mind,
she took the shoes, and thanked the old lady pleasantly
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the company had departed, the godmother still
lingered, and kissed her goddaughter affectionately. “If your
children inherit your good sense and good temper, my love,
they will need nothing an old woman like me can give them,”
said she; “but, all the same, my little gift is not <span class='it'>quite</span> so
shabby as it looks. These shoes have another quality besides
that of not wearing out. The little feet that are in them cannot
very easily go wrong. If, when your boy is old enough,
you send him to school in these shoes, should he be disposed
to play truant, they will pinch and discomfit him so that it is
probable he will let his shoes take him the right way; they
will in like manner bring him home at the proper time.
And——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Godmother’s broomstick at the door!” shouted the
farming man who was acting as footman on this occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear,” said the old lady, “you will find out
their virtues all in good time, and they will do for the whole
family in turn; for I really can come to no more christenings.
I am getting old—besides, our day is over. Farewell, my
love.” And mounting her broomstick, the fairy finally departed.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>KINGCUPS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> years went by, and her family increased, the mother
learned the full value of the little shoes. Her nine boys wore
them in turn, but they never wore them out. So long as the
fairy shoes were on their feet they were pretty sure to go
where they were sent and to come back when they were
wanted, which, as all parents know, is no light matter. Moreover,
during the time that each boy wore them, he got into
such good habits that he was thenceforward comparatively
tractable. At last they descended to the ninth and youngest
boy, and became—Timothy’s shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the eighth boy had very small feet, so he had worn
the shoes rather longer, and Timothy got them somewhat
later than usual. Then, despite her conscientiousness, Timothy’s
mother was not above the weakness of spoiling the
youngest of the family; and so, for one reason or another,
Master Timothy was wilful, and his little feet pretty well
used to taking their own way before he stepped into the fairy
shoes. But he played truant from the dame’s school and
was late for dinner so often, that at length his mother resolved
to bear it no longer; and one morning the leather
shoes were brightly blacked and the copper tips polished,
and Master Tim was duly shod, and dismissed to school with
many a wise warning from his fond parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Tim, dear, I know you will be a good boy,” said
his mother, a strong conviction that he would be no such
thing pricking her conscience. “And mind you don’t loiter
or play truant, for if you do, these shoes will pinch you horribly,
and you’ll be sure to be found out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tim’s mother held him by his right arm, and Tim’s left
arm and both his legs were already as far away as he could
stretch them, and Tim’s face looked just as incredulous as
yours would look if you were told that there was a bogy in
the store-closet who would avenge any attack upon the jam-pots
with untold terrors. At last the good woman let go her
hold, and Tim went off like an arrow from a bow, and he
gave not one more thought to what his mother had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The past winter had been very cold, the spring had been
fitful and stormy, and May had suddenly burst upon the
country with one broad bright smile of sunshine and flowers.
If Tim had loitered on the school path when the frost nipped
his nose and numbed his toes, or when the trees were bare
and the ground muddy, and the March winds crept up his
jacket-sleeves, one can imagine the temptations to delay when
every nook had a flower and every bush a bird. It is very
wrong to play truant, but still it was very tempting.
Twirr-r-r-r-r—up into the blue sky went the larks; hedge-birds
chirped and twittered in and out of the bushes, the pale
milkmaids opened their petals, and down in the dark marsh
below the kingcups shone like gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once or twice Tim loitered to pick milkmaids and white
starflowers and speedwell; but the shoes pinched him, and
he ran on all the more willingly that a newly fledged butterfly
went before him. But when the path ran on above the
marsh, and he looked down and saw the kingcups, he dismissed
all thoughts of school. True, the bank was long and
steep, but that only added to the fun. Kingcups he must
have. The other flowers he flung away. Milkmaids are
wan-looking at the best; starflowers and speedwell are
ragged; but those shining things that he had not seen for
twelve long months, with cups of gold and leaves like water-lilies—Tim
flung his satchel on to the grass, and began to
scramble down the bank. But though he turned his feet towards
the kingcups, the shoes seemed resolved to go to
school; and as he persisted in going towards the marsh, he
suffered such twitches and twinges that he thought his feet
must have been wrenched off. But Tim was a very resolute
little fellow, and though his ankles bid fair to be dislocated
at every step, he dragged himself, shoes and all, down to the
marsh. And now, provokingly enough, he could not find a
kingcup within reach; in very perversity, as it seemed, not
one would grow on the safe edge, but, like so many Will-o’-the-wisps,
they shone out of the depths of the treacherous
bog. And as Tim wandered round the marsh, jerk, wrench—oh,
dear! every step was like a galvanic shock. At last,
desperate with pain and disappointment, he fairly jumped
into a brilliant clump that looked tolerable near, and was at
once ankle-deep in water. Then, to his delight, the wet mud
sucked the shoes off his feet, and he waded about among the
rushes, reeds, and kingcups, sublimely happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was none the worse, though he ought to have been.
He moved about very cautiously, feeling his way with a stick
from tussock to tussock of reedy grass, and wondering how
his eight brothers had been so feeble-minded as never to
think of throwing the obnoxious shoes into a bog and so getting
rid of them once for all. True, in fairy stories, the
youngest brother always does accomplish what his elders had
failed to do: but fairy tales are not always true. At last
Tim began to feel tired; he hurt his foot with a sharp stump.
A fat yellow frog jumped up in his face and so startled him
that he nearly fell backwards into the water. He was frightened,
and had culled more kingcups than he could carry. So
he scrambled out, and climbed the bank, and cleaned himself
up as well as he could with a small cotton pocket handkerchief,
and thought he would go on to school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, with all his faults, Tim was no coward and no liar,
so with a quaking heart and a stubborn face he made up
his mind to tell the dame that he had played truant; but
even when one has resolved to confess, the words lag behind,
and Tim was still composing a speech in his mind, and
had still got no farther than, “Please, ma’am,” when he
found himself in the school and under the dame’s very eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tim heeded not her frown, nor the subdued titters of
the children; his eyes were fixed on the schoolroom floor,
where—in Tim’s proper place in the class—stood the little
leather shoes, very muddy, and with a kingcup in each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been in the marsh, Timothy,” said the dame.
“<span class='it'>Put on your shoes.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be believed that when his punishment and his lessons
were over, Tim allowed his shoes to take him quietly
home.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SHOES AT SCHOOL.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> Timothy’s mother heard how he had been in the
marsh, she decided to send him at once to a real boys’ school,
as he was quite beyond dame’s management. So he went to
live with Dr. Dixon Airey, who kept a school on the moors,
assisted by one Usher, a gentleman who had very long legs
and used very long words, and who wore common spectacles
of very high power on work days, and green ones on Sundays
and holidays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Timothy’s shoes went with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole he liked being at school. He liked the
boys, he did not hate Dr. Airey much, and he would have
felt kindly towards the Usher but for certain exasperating
circumstances. The Usher was accustomed to illustrate his
lessons by examples from familiar objects, and as he naturally
had not much imagination left after years of grinding at
the rudiments of everything with a succession of lazy little
boys, he took the first familiar objects that came to hand,
and his examples were apt to be tame. Now though Timothy’s
shoes were well-known in his native village, they created
quite a sensation in Dr. Dixon Airey’s establishment,
and the Usher brought them into his familiar examples till
Timothy was nearly frantic. Thus: “If Timothy’s shoes
cost 8<span class='it'>s.</span> 7<span class='it'>d.</span> without the copper tips, &amp;c.” or, illustrating
the genitive case, “Timothy’s shoes, or the shoes of Timothy,”
or again: “The shoes. Of the shoes. To or for the
shoes. The shoes. O shoes! By, with, or from the
shoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll run away by, with, or from the shoes shortly,”
groaned Timothy, “see if I don’t. I can’t stand it any
longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t mind it, if I were you,” returned Bramble
minor. “They all do it. Look at the fellow who wrote the
Latin Grammar! He looks around the schoolroom, and the
first thing that catches his eyes goes down for the first declension,
<span class='it'>forma</span>, a form. They’re all alike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the fruit season came round, and boys now and
then smuggled cherries into school, which were forfeited by
the Usher, he sometimes used these for illustrations instead
of the shoes, thus (in the arithmetic class): “Two hundred
and fifty-four cherries added to one thousand six hundred
and seventy-five will make——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A <span class='it'>very</span> big pie!” cried Tim on one of these occasions.
He had been sitting half asleep in the sunshine, his mind
running on the coming enjoyments of the fruit season,
cooked and uncooked; the Usher had appealed to him unexpectedly,
and the answer was out of his lips before he could
recollect himself. Of course he was sent to the bottom of the
class; and the worst of going down in class for Timothy
was that his shoes were never content to rest
there. They pinched his poor feet till he shuffled them
off in despair, and then they pattered back to his proper place
where they stayed till, for very shame, Tim was obliged to
work back to them: and if he kept down in his class for two
or three days, for so long he had to sit in his socks, for the
shoes always took the place that Tim ought to have filled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, after all, it was pleasant enough at that school upon
the moors, from the time when the cat heather came out
upon the hills to the last of the blackberries; and even in
winter, when the northern snow lay deep, and the big dam
was “safe” for skaters, and there was a slide from the
Doctor’s gate to the village post-office—one steep descent of
a quarter of a mile on the causeway, and as smooth as the
glass mountain climbed by the princes in the fairy tale. Then
Saturday was a half-holiday, and the boys were allowed to
ramble off on long country walks, and if they had been particularly
good they were allowed to take out Nardy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the Doctor’s big dog, a noble fellow of St.
Bernard breed. The Doctor called him Bernardus, but the
boys called him Nardy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, too, the Usher would take one or two boys for
a treat to the neighboring town, and when the Usher went
out holidaying, he always wore the green spectacles, through
which he never saw anything amiss, and indeed (it was
whispered) saw very little at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altogether Timothy would have been happy but for the
shoes. They did him good service in many ways, it
is true. When Timothy first came the little boys
groaned under the tyranny of a certain big bully of whom
all were afraid. One day when he was maltreating Bramble
minor in a shameful and most unjust fashion, Timothy rushed
at him and with the copper tips of his unerring shoes he
kicked him so severely that the big bully did not get over it
for a week, and no one feared him any more. Then in races,
and all games of swift and skilful chase, Timothy’s shoes won
him high renown. But they made him uncomfortable whenever
he went wrong, and left him no peace till he went right,
and he grumbled loudly against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a right way and a wrong way in all sublunary
affairs,” said the Usher. “Hereafter, young gentleman,
you will appreciate your singular felicity in being incapable
of taking the wrong course without feeling uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of his talking like that?” said Timothy,
kicking the bench before him with his “copper tips.” “I
don’t want to go the wrong way, I only want to go my own
way, that’s all.” And night and day he beat his brains for a
good plan to rid himself of the fairy shoes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SHOES AT CHURCH.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>On</span> Sunday, Dr. Dixon Airey’s school went to the old
church in the valley. It was a venerable building with a
stone floor, and when Dr. Dixon Airey’s young gentlemen
came in they made such a clattering with their feet that
everybody looked round. So the Usher very properly made
a point of being punctual that they might not disturb the
congregation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Usher always went to church with the boys, and he
always wore his green spectacles. It has been hinted that on
Sundays and holidays he was slow to see anything amiss.
Indeed if he were directly told of misconduct he would only
shake his head and say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Humanum est errare</span>, my dear boy, as Dr. Kerchever
Arnold truly remarks in one of the exercises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the boys liked him all the better, and did not on the
whole behave any the worse for this occasional lenity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four times in the year, on certain Sunday afternoons, the
young people of the neighborhood were publicly catechised
in the old church after the second lesson at Evening Prayer,
and Dr. Dixon Airey’s young gentlemen with the rest.
They all filed down on the nave in a certain order, and every
boy knew beforehand which question and answer would fall
to his share. Now Timothy’s mother had taught him the Catechism
very thoroughly, and so on a certain Sunday he found
that the lengthy answer to the question, “What is thy duty
towards thy neighbor?” had been given to him. He knew
it quite well; but a stupid, half-shy, and wholly aggravating
fit came upon him, and he resolved that he would not stand
up with the others to say his Catechism in church. So when
they were about half-way there, Timothy slipped off unnoticed,
and the Usher—all confidence and green spectacles—took
the rest of the party on without him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, how the shoes pinched Tim’s feet as he ran away over
the heather, and how Tim vowed in his heart never to rest
till he got rid of them! At last the wrenching became so intolerable
that Tim tore them off his feet, and kicked them
for very spite. Fortunately for Tim’s shins the shoes did not
kick back again, but they were just setting off after the
Usher, when Tim snatched them up and put them in his
pocket. At last he found among the gray rocks that peeped
out of the heather and bracken, one that he could just move,
and when he had pushed it back, he popped the shoes under
it, and then rolled the heavy boulder back on them to keep
them fast. After which he ate bilberries till his teeth were
blue, and tried to forget the shoes and to enjoy himself. But
he could hot do either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the Usher, when he found that Timothy was missing,
he was very much vexed; and when the Psalms were ended
and still he had not come, the Usher took off his green spectacles
and put them into his pocket. And Bramble minor,
who came next to Timothy, kept his Prayer-Book open at
the Church Catechism and read his Duty to his Neighbor instead
of attending to the service. At last the time came,
and all the boys filed down the nave. First the Parish
schools and then Doctor Dixon Airey’s young gentlemen;
and just as they took their places between Bramble minor
and the next boy—in the spot where Timothy should have
been—stood Timothy’s shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After service the shoes walked home with the boys, and
followed the Usher into Dr. Dixon Airey’s study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I regret, sir,” said the Usher, “I deeply regret to have
to report to you that Timothy was absent from Divine worship
this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who did his Duty to his Neighbor?” asked the
Doctor, anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bramble minor, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how did he do it?” asked the Doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Airey and I,” said the Doctor, “shall have much
pleasure in seeing Bramble minor at tea this evening. I believe
there are greengage turnovers. We hope also for the
honor of <span class='it'>your</span> company, sir,” added the Doctor. “And
when Timothy retraces his erring steps, <span class='it'>tell him to come and
fetch his shoes</span>.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE POOR PERSON.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I regret</span> to say that the events just related only confirmed
Timothy in his desire to get rid of his shoes. He took
Bramble minor into his confidence, and they discussed the
matter seriously after they went to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a gift it is to be able to dispose in one trenchant
sentence of a question that has given infinite trouble to those
principally concerned! Most journalists have this talent,
and Bramble minor must have had some of it, for when
Timothy had been stating his grievance in doleful and hopeless
tones, his friend said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of putting them under stones and leaving
them in bogs? Give your shoes to some one who
wants ’em, my boy, and they’ll be kept fast enough, you
may be sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where am I to find any one who wants them?”
asked Timothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, bless your life!” said Bramble minor, “go to the
first poor person’s cottage you come to, and offer them to
the first person you see. Strong shoes with copper tips and
heels will not be refused in a hurry, and will be taken very
good care of, you’ll find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With which Bramble minor rolled over in his little bed
and went to sleep, and Timothy turned over in his, and
thought what a thing it was to have a practical genius—like
Bramble minor! And the first half-holiday he borrowed a
pair of shoes, and put his own in his pocket, and set forth
for the nearest poor person’s cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not go towards the village (it was too public he
thought); he went over the moors, and when he had walked
about half a mile, down by a sandy lane just below him, he
saw a poor person’s cottage. The cottage was so tumble-down
and so old and inconvenient, there could be no doubt
but that it belonged to a poor person, and to a very poor person
indeed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Timothy first rapped at the door he could hear no
answer, but after knocking two or three times he accepted a
faint sound from within as a welcome, and walked into the
cottage. Though more comfortable within than without, it
was unmistakably the abode of a “poor person,” and the
poor person himself was sitting crouched over a small fire,
coughing after a manner that shook the frail walls of the
cottage and his own frailer body. He was an old man and
rather deaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon,” said Timothy, for he did not know
what else to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good day to ye,” coughed the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how are you this afternoon?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No but badly, thank ye,” said the old man; “but I’m a
long age, and it’s what I mun expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t feel as if a small pair of strong leather shoes
would be of any use to you?” asked Tim in his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh? Shoes? It’s not many shoes I’m bound to wear
out now. These’ll last my time, I expect. I’m a long age,
sir. But thank ye kindly all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tim was silent, partly because the object of his visit had
failed, partly with awe of the old man, whose time was
measured by the tattered slippers on his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You be one of Dr. Airey’s young gentlemen, I reckon,”
said the old man at last. Tim nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how’s the old gentleman? He wears well, do the
Doctor. And I expect he’s a long age, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s about sixty, I believe,” said Timothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thowt he’d been better nor seventy,” said the old man,
in almost an injured tone, for he did not take much interest
in any one younger than threescore years and ten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any children?” asked Tim, still thinking of
the shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four buried and four living,” said the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps <span class='it'>they</span> might like a pair——” began Timothy;
but the old man had gone on without heeding him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all four on ’em married and settled, and me alone;
for my old woman went Home twenty years back, come next
fift’ o’ March.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daresay you have grandchildren, then?” said Tim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay. Tom’s wife’s brought him eleven, <span class='it'>so</span> fur; and
six on ’em boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not very rich, I daresay,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rich!” cried the old man; “Why, bless ye, last year
Tom were out o’ work six month, and they were a’most
clemmed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry,” said Tim; “and will you please give them
these shoes? They’re sure to fit one of the boys, and they
are very very strong leather, and copper-tipped and heeled,
and——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as Tim enumerated the merits of his shoes the old
man tried to speak, and could not for a fit of coughing, and
as he choked and struggled he put back the shoes with his
hand. At last he found voice to gasp,—“Lor’, bless you,
Tom’s in Osstraylee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever did he go there for?” cried Tim, impatiently,
for he saw no prospect of getting rid of his tormentors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d nowt to do at home, and he’s doing well out yonder.
He says he’ll send me some money soon, but I doubt
it won’t be in time for my burying. I’m a long age,” muttered
the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tim put the shoes in his pocket again, and pulled out a
few coppers, the remains of his pocket-money. These the
old man gratefully accepted, and Tim departed. And as he
was late, he took off the borrowed shoes and put on his
own once more, for they carried him quicker over the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so they were still Timothy’s shoes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE DIRTY BOY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>One</span> day the Usher invited Timothy to walk to the town
with him. It was a holiday. The Usher wore his green
spectacles; Tim had a few shillings of pocket-money, and
plums were in season. Altogether the fun promised to be
good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timothy and the Usher had so much moor breeze and
heather scents every day, that they quite enjoyed the
heavier air of the valley and the smell and smoke of town
life. Just as they entered the first street a dirty little boy,
in rags and with bare feet, ran beside them, and as he ran
he talked. And it was all about his own trouble and poverty,
and hunger and bare feet, and he spoke very fast, with
a kind of whine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel quite ashamed, Timothy,” said the Usher (who
worked hard for twelve hours a day, and supported a blind
mother and two sisters),—“I feel quite ashamed to be out
holidaying when a fellow-creature is barefooted and in
want.” And as he spoke the Usher gave a sixpence to the
dirty little boy (who never worked at all, and was supported
by kind people out walking). And when the dirty little
boy had got the sixpence, he bit it with his teeth and rang
it on the stones, and then danced catherine-wheels on the
pavement till somebody else came by. But the Usher did
not see this through his green spectacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Timothy thought, “My shoes would fit that barefooted
boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After they had enjoyed themselves very much for some
time, the Usher had to pay a business visit in the town, and
he left Timothy to amuse himself alone for a while. And
Timothy walked about, and at last he stopped in front of a
bootmaker’s shop, and in the window he saw a charming little
pair of boots just his own size. And when he turned away
from the window, he saw something coming very fast along
the pavement like the three legs on an Isle of Man halfpenny,
and when it stood still it was the barefooted boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Timothy went into the shop, and bought the boots,
and this took all his money to the last farthing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he came out of the shop the dirty little boy
was still there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, my poor boy,” said Tim, speaking like a
young gentleman out of ‘Sanford and Merton.’ “You look
very poor, and your feet must be very cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dirty boy whined afresh, and said his feet were so
bad he could hardly walk. They were frost-bitten, sun-blistered,
sore, and rheumatic; and he expected shortly to
become a cripple like his parents and five brothers, all from
going barefoot. And Timothy stooped down and took off
the little old leather shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give you these shoes, boy,” said he, “on one condition.
You must promise not to lose them, nor to give
them away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catch me!” cried the dirty boy, as he took the shoes.
And his voice seemed quite changed, and he put one of his
dirty fingers by the side of his nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could easily catch you if I wished,” said Tim. (For
slang was not allowed in Dr. Dixon Airey’s establishment,
and he did not understand the remark.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you <span class='it'>are</span> green!” said the dirty boy, putting on
the shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no business of yours what color I am,” said Tim,
angrily. “You’re black, and that’s your own fault for not
washing yourself. And if you’re saucy or ungrateful, I’ll
kick you—at least, I’ll try,” he added, for he remembered
that he no longer wore the fairy shoes, and could not be sure
of kicking or catching anybody now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walker!” cried the dirty boy. But he did not walk,
he ran, down the street as fast as he could go, and Timothy
was parted from his shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a sigh, just one sigh, and then he put on the
new boots, and went to meet the Usher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Usher was at the door of a pastrycook’s shop, and he
took Tim in, and they had veal-pies and ginger-wine; and
the Usher paid the bill. And all this time he beamed
affably through his green spectacles, and never looked at
Timothy’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they went out into the street, where there was an
interesting smell of smoke, and humanity, and meat, and
groceries, and drapery, and drugs, quite different to the
moor air, and the rattling and bustling were most stimulating.
And Tim and the Usher looked in at all the shop-windows
gratis, and choose the things they would have
bought if they had had the money. At last the Usher went
into a shop and bought for Tim a kite which he had admired;
and Tim would have given everything he possessed to have
been able to buy some small keep-sake for the Usher, but he
could not, for he had spent all his pocket-money on the new
boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached the bottom of the street, the Usher
said, “Suppose we go up the other side and look at the
shops there.” And when they were half way up the other
side, they found a small crowd round the window of a print-seller,
for a new picture was being exhibited in the window.
And outside the crowd was the dirty boy, but Tim and the
Usher did not see him. And they squeezed in through the
crowd and saw the picture. It was a historical subject with
a lot of figures, and they were all dressed so like people on
the stage of a theatre that Tim thought it was a scene out
of Shakespeare. But the Usher explained that it was the
signing of the Magna Charta, or the Foundation Stone of
our National Liberties, and he gave quite a nice little lecture
about it, and the crowd said, “Hear, hear!” But as everybody
wanted to look at King John at the same moment
when the Usher called him “treacherous brother and base
tyrant,” there was a good deal of pushing, and Tim and he
had to stand arm-in-arm to keep together at all. And thus
it was that when the dirty boy from behind put his hand in
the Usher’s waistcoat pocket, and took out the silver watch
that had belonged to his late father, the Usher thought it
was Tim’s arm that seemed to press his side, and Tim
thought it was the Usher’s arm that <span class='it'>he</span> felt. But just as
the dirty boy had secured the watch the shoes gave him such
a terrible twinge, that he started in spite of himself. And
in his start he jerked the Usher’s waistcoat, and in one
moment the Usher forgot what he was saying about our
national liberties, and recalled (as with a lightning flash)
the connection between crowds and our national pickpockets.
And when he clapped his hand to his waistcoat—his watch
was gone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My watch has been stolen!” cried the Usher, and, as he
turned round, the dirty boy fled, and Tim, the Usher, and
the crowd ran after him crying, “Stop thief!” and every
one they met turned round and ran with them, and at the
top of the street they caught a policeman, and were nearly
as glad as if they had caught the thief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now if the dirty boy had still been barefoot no one could
ever have stopped <span class='it'>him</span>. But the wrenching and jerking of
the shoes made running most difficult, and just as he was
turning a corner they gave one violent twist that turned him
right round, and he ran straight into the policeman’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the policeman whipped out the watch as neatly as if
he had been a pickpocket himself, and gave it back to the
Usher. And the dirty boy yelled, and bit the policeman’s
hand, and butted him in the chest with his head, and kicked
his shins; but the policeman never lost his temper, and only
held the dirty boy fast by the collar of his jacket, and shook
him slightly. When the policeman shook him, the dirty
boy shook himself violently, and went on shaking in the
most ludicrous way, pretending that it was the policeman’s
doing, and he did it so cleverly that Tim could not help
laughing. And then the dirty boy danced, and shook himself
faster and faster, as a conjuror shakes his chains of iron
rings. And as he shook, he shook the shoes off his feet, and
drew his arms in, and ducked his head, and, as the policeman
was telling the Usher about a pickpocket he had
caught the day before yesterday, the dirty boy gave one
wriggle, dived, and leaving his jacket in the policeman’s
hand, fled a way like the wind on his bare feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The policeman looked seriously annoyed; but the Usher
said he was very glad, as he shouldn’t like to prosecute anybody,
and had never been in a police-court in his life. And he
gave the policeman a shilling for his trouble, and the policeman
said the court “wouldn’t be no novelty to him,”—meaning
to the dirty boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the crowd had dispersed, Timothy told the
Usher about the boots, and said he was very sorry; and the
Usher accepted his apologies, and said, “<span class='it'>Humanum est errare</span>,
my dear boy, as Dr. Kerchever Arnold truly remarks in one
of the exercises.” Then Timothy went to the bootmaker,
who agreed to take back the boots “for a consideration.”
And with what was left of his money, Tim bought some things
for himself and for Bramble minor and for the Usher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the shoes took him very comfortably home.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CHILDREN’S PARTY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> Timothy went home for the Christmas holidays, his
mother thought him greatly improved. His friends thought
so too, and when Tim had been at home about a week, a lady
living in the same town invited him to a children’s party and
dance. It was not convenient for any one to go with him;
but his mother said, “I think you are to be trusted now,
Timothy, especially in the shoes. So you shall go, but on
one condition. The moment ten o’clock strikes, you must
start home at once. Now remember!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can come home in proper time without those clod-hopping
shoes,” said Timothy to himself. “It is really too bad
to expect one to go to a party in leather shoes with copper
tips and heels!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he privately borrowed a pair of pumps belonging to
his next brother, made of patent leather and adorned with
neat little bows, and he put a bit of cotton wool into each toe
to make them fit. And he went by a little by-lane at the
back of the house, to avoid passing under his mother’s window,
for he was afraid she might see the pumps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the little by-lane was very badly lighted, and there
were some queer-looking people loitering about, and one of
them shouted something at him, and Timothy felt frightened,
and walked on pretty fast. And then he heard
footsteps behind him, and walked faster, and still the footsteps
followed him, and at last he ran. Then they ran too,
and he did not dare to look behind. And the footsteps followed
him all down the by-lane and into the main street and
up to the door of the lady’s house, where Tim pulled the bell
and turned to face his pursuer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nothing was to be seen save Timothy’s little old
leather shoes, which stood beside him on the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your shoes, sir?” said the very polite footman who
opened the door. And he carried the shoes inside, and Tim
was obliged to put them on and leave the pumps with the
footman, for (as he said) “they’ll be coming up stairs, and
making a fool of me in the ball-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tim had no reason to regret the exchange. Other people
are not nearly so much interested in one’s appearance as one
is oneself; and then they danced so beautifully that every
little girl in the room wanted Tim for her partner, and he
was perfectly at home, even in the Lancers. He went down
twice to supper, and had lots of gooseberry-fool; and they
were just about to dance Sir Roger de Coverley, when the
clock struck ten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tim knew he ought to go, but a very nice little girl wanted
to dance with him, and Sir Roger is the best of fun, and he
thought he would just stay till it was over. But though he
secured his partner and began, the shoes made dancing more
a pain than a pleasure to him. They pinched him, they
twitched him, they baulked his <span class='it'>glissades</span>, and once when he
should have gone down the room they fairly turned him
around and carried him off towards the door. The other
dancers complained, and Tim kicked off the shoes in a pet,
and resolved to dance it out in his socks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the shoes were gone, Tim found how much the
credit of his dancing was due to them. He could not remember
the figure. He swung the little lady round when he
should have bowed, and bowed when he should have taken
her hand, and led the long line of boys the wrong way, and
never made a triumphal arch at all. The boys scolded and
squabbled, the little ladies said he had had too much gooseberry-fool,
and at last Timothy left them and went down
stairs. Here he got the little pumps from the footman and
started home. He ran to make up for lost time, and as he
turned out of the first street he saw the leather shoes running
before him, the copper tips shining in the lamplight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he reached his own door the little shoes were
waiting on the threshold.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SNOW STORM.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> Timothy went back to school in the beginning of
the year, the snow lay deep upon the moors. The boys made
colossal snow men and buried things deep under drifts, for
the dog Bernardus to fetch out. On the ice Timothy’s shoes
were invaluable. He was the best skater and slider in the
school, and when he was going triumphantly down a long
slide with his arms folded and his friends cheering, Tim was
very glad he had not given away his shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One Saturday the Usher took him and Bramble minor for
a long walk over the hills. They had tea with a friendly
farmer, whose hospitality would hardly let them go. So they
were later than they had intended, and about the time that
they set out to return a little snow began to fall. It was
small snow, and fell very quietly. But though it fell so
quietly, it was wonderful how soon the walls and gates got covered;
and though the flakes were small they were so dense
that in a short time no one could see more than a few yards
in front of him. The Usher thought it was desirable to get
home as quickly as possible, and he proposed to take a short
cut across the moors, instead of following the high road all
the way. So they climbed a wall, and ploughed their way
through the untrodden snow, and their hands and feet grew
bitterly painful and then numb, and the soft snow lodged in
their necks and drifted on to their eyelashes and into their
ears, and at last Timothy fairly cried. For he said, that
besides the biting of the frost his shoes pinched and pulled
his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because we are not on the high road,” said the
Usher; “but this will take half an hour off our journey, and
in five minutes we shall strike the road again, and then the
shoes will be all right. Bear it for a few minutes longer if
you can, Tim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tim found it so hard to bear, that the Usher took him
on to his back and took his feet into his hands, and Bramble
minor carried the shoes. And five minutes passed but they
did not strike the road, and five more minutes passed, and
though Tim lay heavy upon the Usher’s shoulder (for he was
asleep) the Usher’s heart was heavier still. And five
minutes more passed, and Bramble minor was crying, and
the Usher said, “Boys, we’ve lost our way. I see nothing
for it but to put Timothy’s shoes down and follow them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Bramble minor put down the shoes, and they started
off to the left, and the Usher and the boys followed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the shoes tripped lightly over the top of the snow, and
went very fast, and the Usher and Bramble minor waded
slowly through it, and in a few seconds the shoes disappeared
into the snowstorm, and they lost sight of them altogether,
and Bramble minor said—“I <span class='it'>can’t</span> go any further. I don’t
mind being left, but I must lie down, I am so very, very
tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Usher woke Timothy, and made him put on
Bramble minor’s boots and walk, and he took Bramble
minor on to his back, and made Timothy take hold of his
coat, and they struggled on through the storm, going as
nearly as they could in the way that the shoes had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you getting on, Timothy?” asked the Usher
after a long silence. “Don’t be afraid of holding on to me,
my boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Timothy gave no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep a brave heart, laddie!” cried the Usher, as
cheerfully as his numb and languid lips could speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still there was silence, and when he looked round,
<span class='it'>Timothy was not there</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When and where he had lost his hold the distracted Usher
had no idea. He shouted in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could I let him take off the shoes?” groaned the
poor man. “Oh! what shall I do? Shall I struggle on to
save this boy’s life, or risk all our lives by turning back after
the other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned round as he spoke, and the wild blast and driving
snow struck him in the face. The darkness fell rapidly,
the drifts grew deeper, and yet the Usher went after
Timothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he found him, but too late—for his own strength was
exhausted, and the snow was three feet deep all round him.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BERNARDUS ON DUTY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> the snow first began to fall, Dr. Dixon Airey observed,—“Our
friends will get a sprinkling of sugar this
evening;” and the boys laughed, for this was one of Dr.
Dixon Airey’s winter jokes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it got dusk, and the storm thickened, Dr. Dixon
Airey said—“I hope they will come home soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the darkness fell, and they did not come, Dr.
Dixon Airey said, “I think they must have remained at the
farm.” And when an hour passed and nothing was to be
seen or heard without but the driving wind and snow, the
Doctor said, “Of course they are at the farm. Very wise
and proper.” And he drew the study curtains, and took up
a newspaper, and rang for tea. But the Doctor could not
eat his tea, and he did not read his paper, and every five
minutes he opened the front door and looked out, and all
was dark and silent, only a few snow-flakes close to him
looked white as they fell through the light from the open
door. And the Doctor said, “There can’t be the slightest
doubt they are at the farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Dr. Dixon Airey opened the door for the seventh
time, Timothy’s shoes ran in, and they were filled with snow.
And when the Doctor saw them he covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a moment more he had sent his man-servant to the
village for help, and Mrs. Airey was filling his flask with
brandy, and he was tying on his comforter and cap, and
fastening his leggings and great-coat. Then he took his
lantern and went out in the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there lay Bernardus with his big nose at the door of
his kennel smelling the storm. And when he saw the light
and heard footsteps, his great, melancholy, human eyes
brightened, and he moaned with joy. And when the men
came up from the village and moved about with shovels and
lanterns, he was nearly frantic, for he thought, “This looks
like business;” and he dragged at his kennel, as much as to
say, “If you don’t let me off the chain now, of all moments,
I’ll come on my own responsibility and bring the kennel
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Doctor unfastened the chain, and he tied
Timothy’s shoes round the dog’s neck, saying, “Perhaps
they will help to lead their wearer aright.” And either the
shoes did pull in the right direction, or the sagacity of Bernardus
sufficed him, for he started off without a moment’s
hesitation. The men followed him as fast as they were able,
and from time to time Bernardus would look round to see if
they were coming, and would wait for them. But if he saw
the lanterns he was satisfied and went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a rare good thing there’s some dumb animals
cleverer than we are ourselves,” observed one of the laborers
as they struggled blindly through the snow, the lanterns
casting feeble and erratic patches of light for a yard or two
before their feet. To Bernardus his own wonderful gift was
light, and sight, and guide, its own sufficient stimulus, and
its own reward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s some’at amiss,” said another man presently;
“t’dog’s whining; he’s stuck fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or perhaps he has found something,” said the Doctor
trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor was right. He had found Timothy and
Bramble minor, and the Usher: and they were still alive.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Airey,” said the Doctor, as an hour later, they sat
round the study fire wrapped in blankets, and drinking
tumblers of hot compounds—“Mrs. Airey, that is a creature
above kennels. From this eventful evening I wish him to
sleep under our roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Airey began, “Bless him!” and then burst
into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Bernardus, who lay with his large eyes upon the
fire, rejoiced in the depths of his doggish heart.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SHOES GO HOME.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is hardly needful to say that Timothy was reconciled
to his shoes. As to being ashamed of them—he would as
soon have been ashamed of that other true friend of his, the
Usher. He would no more have parted with them now than
Dr. Dixon Airey would have parted with the dog Bernardus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas! how often it happens that we do not fully value
our best friends till they are about to be taken from us! It
was a painful fact, but Timothy was outgrowing his shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was at home when the day came on which the old
leather shoes into which he could no longer squeeze his feet
were polished for the last time, and put away in a cupboard
in his mother’s room: Timothy blacked them with his own
hands, and the tears were in his eyes as he put them on the
shelf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, good little friends;” said he; “I will try and
walk as you have taught me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timothy’s mother was much affected by this event. She
could not sleep that night for thinking of the shoes in the
cupboard. She seemed to live over again all the long years
of her married life. Her first anxieties, the good conduct
of all her boys, the faithful help of those good friends to her
nine sons in turn—all passed through her mind as she knitted
her brows under the frill of her nightcap and gazed at the
cupboard door with sleepless eyes. “Ah!” she thought,
“how wise the good godmother was! No money, no good
luck, would have done for my boys what the early training
of these shoes has done. That early discipline which makes
the prompt performance of duty a habit in childhood, is indeed
the quickest relief to parental anxieties, and the firmest
foundation for the fortunes of one’s children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such, and many more, were the excellent reflections of
this conscientious woman; but excellent as they were, they
shall not be recorded here. One’s own experience preaches
with irresistible eloquence; but the second-hand sermons of
other people’s lives are apt to seem tedious and impertinent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her meditations kept her awake till dawn. The sun was
just rising, and the good woman was just beginning to feel
sleepy, and had once or twice lost sight of the bed-room furniture
in a half-dream, when she was startled by the familiar
sound as of a child jumping down from some height to the floor.
The habit of years was strong on her, and she cried, “Bless
the boy! He’ll break his neck!” as she had had reason to
exclaim about one or other of her nine sons any day for the
last twenty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as she spoke the cupboard door swung slowly open,
and Timothy’s shoes came out and ran across the floor.
They paused for an instant by his mother’s bed, as if to say
farewell, and then the bed-room door opened also and let
them pass. Down the stairs they went, and they ran with
that music of a childish patter that no foot in the house
could make now; and the mother sobbed to hear it for the
last time. Then she thought, “The house door’s locked,
they can’t go right away yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in that moment she heard the house door turn slowly
on its hinges. Then she jumped out of bed, and ran to the
window, pushed it open, and leaned out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front of the house was a little garden, and the little
garden was kept by a gate, and beyond the gate was a road,
and beyond the road was a hill, and on the grass of the hill
the dew lay thick and white, and morning mists rested on
the top. The little shoes pattered through the garden, and
the gate opened for them and snecked after them. And
they crossed the road, and went over the hill, leaving little
footprints in the dew. And they passed into the morning
mists, and were lost to sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the sun looked over the hill and dried the dew,
and sent away the mists, <span class='sc'>Timothy’s Shoes</span> were gone.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they never come back,” said Timothy’s mother, “I
shall know that I am to have no more children!” and
though she had certainly had her share, she sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they never did come back; and Timothy remained
the youngest of the family.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Can</span> you fancy, young people,” said Godfather Garbel,
winking with his prominent eyes, and moving his feet backwards
and forwards in his square shoes, so that you could
hear the squeak-leather, half a room off—“can you fancy
my having been a very little boy, and having a godmother?
But I had, and she sent me presents on my birthdays too.
And young people did not get presents when I was a child
as they get them now. We had not half so many toys as
you have, but we kept them twice as long. I think we were
fonder of them too, though they were neither so handsome,
nor so expensive as these new-fangled affairs you are always
breaking about the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, middle-class folk were more saving then. My
mother turned and dyed her dresses, and when she had done
with them, the servant was very glad to have them; but,
bless me! your mother’s maids dress so much finer than
their mistress, I do not think they would say ‘thank you’
for her best Sunday silk. The bustle’s the wrong shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that you are laughing at, little miss? It’s
<span class='it'>pannier</span>, is it? Well, well, bustle or pannier, call it what
you like; but only donkeys wore panniers in my young
days, and many’s the ride I’ve had in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, as I say, my relations and friends thought twice
before they pulled out five shillings in a toy-shop, but they
didn’t forget me, all the same. On my eighth birthday my
mother gave me a bright blue comforter of her own knitting.
My little sister gave me a ball. My mother had cut out the
divisions from various bits in the rag bag, and my sister had
done some of the seaming. It was stuffed with bran, and
had a cork inside which had broken from old age, and would
no longer fit the pickle jar it belonged to. This made the
ball bound when we played ‘prisoner’s base.’ My father
gave me the riding-whip that had lost the lash and the top
of the handle, and an old pair of his gloves, to play coachman
with; these I had long wished for. Kitty the servant
gave me a shell that she had had by her for years. How I
had coveted that shell! It had this remarkable property:
when you put it to your ear you could hear the roaring of
the sea. I had never seen the sea, but Kitty was born in a
fisherman’s cottage, and many an hour have I sat by the
kitchen fire whilst she told me strange stories of the mighty
ocean, and ever and anon she would snatch the shell from
the mantelpiece and clap it to my ear, crying, ‘There child,
you couldn’t hear it plainer than that. It’s the very moral!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Kitty gave me that shell for my very own I felt
that life had little more to offer. I held it to every ear in
the house, including the cat’s; and, seeing Dick the sexton’s
son go by with an armful of straw to stuff Guy Fawkes, I
ran out, and in my anxiety to make him share the treat, and
learn what the sea is like, I clapped the shell to his ear so
smartly and unexpectedly, that he, thinking me to have struck
him, knocked me down then and there with his bundle of
straw. When he understood the rights of the case, he begged
my pardon handsomely, and gave me two whole treacle sticks
and part of a third out of his breeches’ pocket, in return for
which I forgave him freely, and promised to let him hear the
sea roar on every Saturday half-holiday till farther notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, speaking of Dick and the straw reminds me that
my birthday falls on the fifth of November. From this it
came about that I always had to bear a good many jokes
about being burnt as a Guy Fawkes; but, on the other hand,
I was allowed to make a small bonfire of my own, and to
have six potatoes to roast therein, and eight-pennyworth of
crackers to let off in the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On this eighth birthday, having got all the above-named
gifts, I cried, in the fulness of my heart, ‘There never was
such a day!’ And yet there was more to come, for the
evening coach brought me a parcel, and the parcel was my
godmother’s picture book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My godmother was a woman of small means; but she
was accomplished. She could make very spirited sketches,
and knew how to color them after they were outlined and
shaded in India ink. She had a pleasant talent for versifying.
She was very industrious. I have it from her own
lips that she copied the figures in my picture-book from prints
in several different houses at which she visited. They were
fancy portraits of characters, most of which were familiar to
my mind. There were Guy Fawkes, Punch, his then Majesty
the King, Bogy, the Man in the Moon, the Clerk of the
Weather Office, a Dunce, and Old Father Christmas. Beneath
each sketch was a stanza of my godmother’s own composing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My godmother was very ingenious. She had been
mainly guided in her choice of these characters by the prints
she happened to meet with, as she did not trust herself to
design a figure. But if she could not get exactly what she
wanted, she had a clever knack of tracing an outline of the
attitude from some engraving, and altering the figure to suit
her purpose in the finished sketch. She was the soul of
truthfulness, and the notes she added to the index of contents
in my picture-book spoke at once for her honesty in
avowing obligations, and her ingenuity in availing herself of
opportunities. They ran thus:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>No. 1.—<span class='sc'>Guy Fawkes.</span> Outlined from a figure of a warehouse
man rolling a sherry cask into Mr. Rudd’s wine vaults.
I added the hat, the cloak, and boots in the finished drawing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. 2.—<span class='sc'>Punch.</span> I sketched him from the life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. 3.—<span class='sc'>His Most Gracious Majesty the King.</span> On
a quart jug bought in Cheapside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. 4.—<span class='sc'>Bogy</span>, <span class='it'>with bad boys in the bag on his back</span>. Outlined
from Christian bending under his burden, in my mother’s
old copy of the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress.’ The face from
Giant Despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. 5 and No. 6.—<span class='sc'>The Man in the Moon</span>, and <span class='sc'>The
Clerk of the Weather Office</span>. From a book of caricatures
belonging to Dr. James.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. 7.—<span class='sc'>A Dunce.</span> From a steel engraving framed in
rosewood that hangs in my Uncle Wilkinson’s parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. 8.—<span class='sc'>Old Father Christmas.</span> From a German book
at Lady Littleham’s.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My</span> sister Patty was six years old. We loved each
other dearly. The picture-book was almost as much hers as
mine. We sat so long together on one big foot-stool by the
fire, with our arms around each other, and the book resting
on our knees, that Kitty called down blessings on my godmother’s
head for having sent a volume that kept us both so
long out of mischief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If books was allus as useful as that, they’d do for me,’
said she; and though this speech did not mean much, it was
a great deal for Kitty to say; since, not being herself an educated
person, she naturally thought that ‘little enough good
comes of larning.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty and I had our favorites amongst the pictures.
Bogy, now, was a character one did not care to think about
too near bed-time. I was tired of Guy Fawkes, and thought
he looked more natural made of straw, as Dick did him.
The Dunce was a little too personal; but old Father Christmas
took our hearts by storm; we had never seen anything
like him, though now-a-days you may get a plaster figure of
him in any toy-shop at Christmas-time, with hair and beard
like cotton wool, and a Christmas-tree in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The custom of Christmas-trees came from Germany.
I can remember when they were first introduced into England,
and what wonderful things we thought them. Now,
every village school has its tree, and the scholars openly discuss
whether the presents have been ‘good,’ or ‘mean’ as
compared with other trees in former years. The first one
that I ever saw I believed to have come from good Father
Christmas himself; but little boys have grown too wise now
to be taken in for their own amusement. They are not excited
by secret and mysterious preparations in the back drawing-room;
they hardly confess to the thrill—which I feel to
this day—when the folding-doors are thrown open, and amid
the blaze of tapers, mamma, like a Fate, advances with her
scissors to give every one what falls to his lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, young people, when I was eight years old I had
not seen a Christmas-tree, and the first picture of one I ever
saw was the picture of that held by Old Father Christmas in
my godmother’s picture book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What are those things on the tree?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Candles,’ said my father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, father, not the candles; the other things?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Those are toys, my son.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Are they ever taken off?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes, they are taken off, and given to the children who
stand around the tree.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty and I grasped each other by the hand, and with
one voice murmured, ‘How kind of Old Father Christmas!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By-and-by I asked, ‘How old is Father Christmas?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father laughed, and said, ‘One thousand eight hundred
and thirty years, child,’ which was then the year of
our Lord, and thus one thousand eight hundred and thirty
years since the first great Christmas Day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He <span class='it'>looks</span> very old,’ whispered Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I, who was, for my age, what Kitty called ‘Bible-learned,’
said thoughtfully, and with some puzzledness of
mind, ‘Then he’s older than Methusaleh.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my father had left the room, and did not hear my
difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“November and December went by, and still the picture-book
kept all its charm for Patty and me; and we pondered
on and loved Old Father Christmas as children can love and
realize a fancy friend. To those who remember the fancies
of their childhood I need say no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christmas week came, Christmas Eve came. My father
and mother were mysteriously and unaccountably busy in
the parlor (we had only one parlor), and Patty and I were
not allowed to go in. We went into the kitchen, but even
here was no place of rest for us. Kitty was ‘all over the
place,’ as she phrased it, and cakes, mince-pies, and puddings
were with her. As she justly observed, ‘There was
no place there for children and books to sit with their toes
in the fire, when a body wanted to be at the oven all along.
The cat was enough for <span class='it'>her</span> temper,’ she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to puss, who obstinately refused to take a hint which
drove her out into the Christmas frost, she returned again
and again with soft steps, and a stupidity that was, I think,
affected, to the warm hearth, only to fly at intervals, like a
football, before Kitty’s hasty slipper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had more sense, or less courage. We bowed to
Kitty’s behests, and went to the back door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty and I were hardy children, and accustomed to
‘run out’ in all weathers, without much extra wrapping up.
We put Kitty’s shawl over our two heads, and went outside.
I rather hoped to see something of Dick, for it was holiday
time; but no Dick passed. He was busy helping his father
bore holes in the carved seats of the church, which were to
hold sprigs of holly for the morrow—That was the idea of
church decoration in my young days. You have improved
on your elders there, young people, and I am candid enough
to allow it. Still, the sprigs of red and green were better
than nothing, and, like your lovely wreaths and pious devices,
they made one feel as if the old black wood were bursting
into life and leaf again for very Christmas joy; and, if
one only knelt carefully, they did not scratch his nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Dick was busy, and not to be seen. We ran
across the little yard and looked over the wall at the end to
see if we could see anything or anybody. From this point
there was a pleasant meadow field sloping prettily away to a
little hill about three-quarters of a mile distant; which,
catching some fine breezes from the moors beyond, was held
to be a place of cure for whooping-cough, or ‘kincough,’ as
it was vulgarly called. Up to the top of this Kitty had
dragged me, and carried Patty, when we were recovering
from the complaint, as I well remember. It was the only
‘change of air’ we could afford, and I dare say it did as well
as if we had gone into badly-drained lodgings at the seaside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This hill was now covered with snow and stood off
against the gray sky. The white fields looked vast and
dreary in the dusk. The only gay things to be seen were
the berries on the holly hedge, in the little lane—which, running
by the end of our back-yard, led up to the Hall—and
the fat robin, that was staring at me. I was looking at the
robin, when Patty, who had been peering out of her corner
of Kitty’s shawl, gave a great jump that dragged the shawl
from our heads, and cried,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Look!’ ”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>I looked.</span> An old man was coming along the lane.
His hair and beard were as white as cotton-wool. He had a
face like the sort of apple that keeps well in winter; his coat
was old and brown. There was snow about him in patches,
and he carried a small fir-tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same conviction seized upon us both. With one
breath we exclaimed, ‘<span class='it'>It’s old Father Christmas!</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know now that it was only an old man of the place,
with whom we did not happen to be acquainted, and that he
was taking a little fir-tree up to the Hall, to be made into a
Christmas tree. He was a very good-humored old fellow,
and rather deaf, for which he made up by smiling and nodding
his head a good deal, and saying, ‘Aye, aye, <span class='it'>to</span> be
sure!’ at likely intervals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As he passed us and met our earnest gaze, he smiled
and nodded so earnestly that I was bold enough to cry,
‘Good-evening, Father Christmas!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Same to you!’ said he, in a high-pitched voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then you <span class='it'>are</span> Father Christmas,’ said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And a happy New Year,’ was Father Christmas’ reply,
which rather put me out. But he smiled in such a satisfactory
manner, that Patty went on, ‘You’re very old,
aren’t you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So I be, miss, so I be,’ said Father Christmas, nodding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Father says you’re eighteen hundred and thirty years
old,’ I muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Aye, aye, to be sure,’ said Father Christmas, ‘I’m a
very long age.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A <span class='it'>very</span> long age, thought I, and I added, ‘You’re nearly
twice as old as Methusaleh, you know,’ thinking that this
might not have struck him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Aye, aye,’ said Father Christmas; but he did not seem
to think anything of it. After a pause he held up the tree,
and cried, ‘D’ye know what this is, little miss?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A Christmas tree,’ said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the old man smiled and nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I leant over the wall, and shouted, ‘But there are no
candles.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘By-and-by,’ said Father Christmas nodding as before.
‘When it’s dark they’ll all be lighted up. That’ll be a fine
sight!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Toys too, there’ll be, won’t there?’ said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Christmas nodded his head. ‘And sweeties,’ he
added, expressively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could feel Patty trembling, and my own heart beat
fast. The thought which agitated us both, was this—‘Was
Father Christmas bringing the tree to us?’ But very anxiety,
and some modesty also, kept us from asking outright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only when the old man shouldered his tree, and prepared
to move on, I cried in despair, ‘Oh, are you going?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m coming back by-and-by,’ said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How soon?’ cried Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘About four o’clock,’ said the old man smiling, ‘I’m
only going up yonder.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, nodding and smiling as he went, he passed away
down the lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Up yonder.’ This puzzled us. Father Christmas had
pointed, but so indefinitely, that he might have been pointing
to the sky, or the fields, or the little wood at the end of the
Squire’s grounds. I thought the latter, and suggested to
Patty that perhaps he had some place underground like
Aladdin’s cave, where he got the candles, and all the pretty
things for the tree. This idea pleased us both, and we
amused ourselves by wondering what Old Father Christmas
would choose for us from his stores in that wonderful hole
where he dressed his Christmas-trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I wonder, Patty,’ said I, ‘why there’s no picture of
Father Christmas’s dog in the book.’ For at the old man’s
heels in the lane there crept a little brown and white spaniel,
looking very dirty in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Perhaps it’s a new dog that he’s got to take care of his
cave,’ said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we went in-doors we examined the picture afresh
by the dim light from the passage window, but there was no
dog there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father passed us at this moment, and patted my head.
‘Father,’ said I, ‘I don’t know, but I do think Old Father
Christmas is going to bring us a Christmas-tree to-night.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who’s been telling you that?’ said my father. But he
passed on before I could explain that we had seen Father
Christmas himself, and had had his word for it that he would
return at four o’clock, and that the candles on his tree would
be lighted as soon as it was dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We hovered on the outskirts of the rooms till four
o’clock came. We sat on the stairs and watched the big
clock, which I was just learning to read; and Patty made
herself giddy with constantly looking up and counting the
four strokes, towards which the hour hand slowly moved.
We put our noses into the kitchen now and then, to smell
the cakes and get warm, and anon we hung about the parlor
door, and were most unjustly accused of trying to peep.
What did we care what our mother was doing in the parlor?—we,
who had seen Old Father Christmas himself, and were
expecting him back again every moment!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last the church clock struck. The sounds boomed
heavily through the frost, and Patty thought there were four
of them. Then, after due choking and whirring, our own
clock struck, and we counted the strokes quite clearly—one!
two! three! four! Then we got Kitty’s shawl once more,
and stole out into the back-yard. We ran to our old place,
and peeped, but could see nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘We’d better get up on to the wall,’ I said; and with
some difficulty and distress from rubbing her bare knees
against the cold stones, and getting the snow up her sleeves,
Patty got on to the coping of the little wall. I was just
struggling after her, when something warm and something
cold coming suddenly against the bare calves of my legs,
made me shriek with fright. I came down ‘with a run,’
and bruised my knees, my elbows, and my chin; and the
snow that hadn’t gone up Patty’s sleeves, went down my
neck. Then I found that the cold thing was a dog’s nose
and the warm thing was his tongue; and Patty cried from
her post of observation, ‘It’s Father Christmas’s dog and
he’s licking your legs.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It really was the dirty little brown and white spaniel;
and he persisted in licking me, and jumping on me, and
making curious little noises, that must have meant something
if one had known his language. I was rather harassed
at the moment. My legs were sore, I was a little afraid
of the dog and Patty was very much afraid of sitting on the
wall without me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You won’t fall,’ I said to her. ‘Get down, will you?’
I said to the dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Humpty Dumpty fell off a wall,’ said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Bow! wow!’ said the dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pulled Patty down, and the dog tried to pull me
down; but when my little sister was on her feet, to my
relief, he transferred his attentions to her. When he had
jumped at her, and licked her several times, he turned
round and ran away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He’s gone,’ said I; ‘I’m so glad.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But even as I spoke he was back again, crouching at
Patty’s feet, and glaring at her with eyes the color of his
ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Patty was very fond of animals, and when the
dog looked at her she looked at the dog, and then she said to
me, ‘He wants us to go with him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On which (as if he understood our language, though we
were ignorant of his) the spaniel sprang away, and went off
as hard as he could; and Patty and I went after him, a dim
hope crossing my mind—‘Perhaps Father Christmas had
sent him for us.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The idea was rather favored by the fact that the dog led
us up the lane. Only a little way; then he stopped by something
lying in the ditch—and once more we cried in the
same breath, ‘It’s Old Father Christmas!’</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Returning</span> from the Hall, the old man had slipped upon
a bit of ice, and lay stunned in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty began to cry. ‘I think he’s dead,’ she sobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He is so very old, I don’t wonder,’ I murmured; ‘but
perhaps he’s not. I’ll fetch father.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father and Kitty were soon on the spot. Kitty was
as strong as a man; and they carried Father Christmas between
them into the kitchen. There he quickly revived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must do Kitty the justice to say that she did not utter
a word of complaint at this disturbance of her labors; and
that she drew the old man’s chair close up to the oven with
her own hand. She was so much affected by the behavior
of his dog, that she admitted him even to the hearth; on
which puss, being acute enough to see how matters stood,
lay down with her back so close to the spaniel’s that Kitty
could not expel one without kicking both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For our parts, we felt sadly anxious about the tree; otherwise
we could have wished for no better treat than to sit
at Kitty’s round table taking tea with Father Christmas.
Our usual fare of thick bread and treacle was to-night exchanged
for a delicious variety of cakes, which were none the
worse to us for being ‘tasters and wasters’—that is, little
bits of dough, or shortbread, put in to try the state of the
oven, and certain cakes that had got broken or burnt in the
baking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there we sat, helping Old Father Christmas to tea
and cake, and wondering in our hearts what could have become
of the tree. But you see, young people, when I was
a child parents were stricter than they are now. Even before
Kitty died (and she has been dead many a long year)
there was a change, and she said that ‘children got to think
anything became them.’ I think we were taught more honest
shame about certain things than I often see in little boys
and girls now. We were ashamed of boasting, or being
greedy, or selfish; we were ashamed of asking for anything
that was not offered to us, and of interrupting grown-up people,
or talking about ourselves. Why, papas and mammas
now-a-days seem quite proud to let their friends see how bold
and greedy and talkative their children can be! A lady said
to me the other day, ‘You wouldn’t believe, Mr. Garbel,
how forward dear little Harry is for his age. He has his
word in everything, and is not a bit shy; and his papa never
comes home from town but Harry runs to ask if he’s brought
him a present. Papa says he’ll be the ruin of him!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Madam,’ said I, ‘even without your word for it, I am
quite aware that your child is forward. He is forward and
greedy and intrusive, as you justly point out, and I wish you
joy of him when those qualities are fully developed. I think
his father’s fears are well founded.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, bless me! now-a-days, it’s ‘Come and tell Mr.
Smith what a fine boy you are, and how many houses you
can build with your bricks,’ or, ‘The dear child wants everything
he sees,’ or ‘Little pet never lets mamma alone for a
minute; does she, love?’ But in my young days it was,
‘Self-praise is no recommendation’ (as Kitty used to tell
me), or, ‘You’re knocking too hard at No. One’ (as my
father said when we talked about ourselves), or, ‘Little boys
should be seen but not heard’ (as a rule of conduct ‘in company’),
or ‘Don’t ask for what you want, but take what’s
given you, and be thankful.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you see, young people, Patty and I felt a delicacy
in asking Old Father Christmas about the tree. It was
not till we had had tea three times round, with tasters and
wasters to match, that Patty said very gently, ‘It’s quite
dark now.’ And then she heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Burning anxiety overcame me. I leaned towards Father
Christmas, and shouted—I had found out that it was needful
to shout,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I suppose the candles are on the tree now?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Just about putting of ’em on,’ said Father Christmas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And the presents, too?’ said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Aye, aye, <span class='it'>to</span> be sure,’ said Father Christmas, and he
smiled delightfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking what farther questions I might venture
upon, when he pushed his cup towards Patty, saying, ‘Since
you are so pressing, miss, I’ll take another dish.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Kitty, swooping on us from the oven, cried ‘Make
yourself at home, sir; there’s more where these came from.
Make a long arm, Miss Patty, and hand them cakes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we had to devote ourselves to the duties of the table;
and Patty, holding the lid with one hand and pouring with
the other, supplied Father Christmas’s wants with a heavy
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last he was satisfied. I said grace, during which he
stood, and indeed he stood for some time afterwards with his
eyes shut—I fancy under the impression that I was still
speaking. He had just said a fervent ‘Amen,’ and reseated
himself, when my father put his head into the kitchen, and
made this remarkable statement,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Old Father Christmas has sent a tree to the young
people.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty and I uttered a cry of delight, and we forthwith
danced round the old man, saying, ‘Oh, how nice! Oh, how
kind of you!’ which I think must have bewildered him, but
he only smiled and nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Come along,’ said my father, ‘Come children. Come
Reuben. Come Kitty.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he went into the parlor, and we all followed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My godmother’s picture of a Christmas-tree was very
pretty; and the flames of the candles were so naturally done
in red and yellow, that I always wondered that they did not
shine at night. But the picture was nothing to the reality.
We had been sitting almost in the dark, for, as Kitty said,
‘Firelight was quite enough to burn at meal-times.’ And
when the parlor door was thrown open, and the tree, with
lighted tapers on all the branches, burst upon our view, the
blaze was dazzling, and threw such a glory round the little
gifts, and the bags of colored muslin, with acid drops and
pink rose drops and comfits inside, as I shall never forget.
We all got something; and Patty and I, at any rate, believed
that the things came from the stores of Old Father
Christmas. We were not undeceived even by his gratefully
accepting a bundle of old clothes which had been hastily put
together to form his present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were all very happy; even Kitty, I think, though
she kept her sleeves rolled up, and seemed rather to grudge
enjoying herself (a weak point in some energetic characters).
She went back to her oven before the lights were out and the
angel on the top of the tree taken down. She locked up her
present (a little work-box) at once. She often showed it off
afterwards, but it was kept in the same bit of tissue paper
till she died. Our presents certainly did not last so long!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old man died about a week afterwards, so we never
made his acquaintance as a common personage. When he
was buried, his little dog came to us. I suppose he remembered
the hospitality he had received. Patty adopted him,
and he was very faithful. Puss always looked on him with
favor. I hoped during our rambles together in the following
summer that he would lead us at last to the cave where
Christmas-trees are dressed. But he never did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our parents often spoke of his late master as ‘old Reuben,’
but children are not easily disabused of a favorite fancy, and
in Patty’s thoughts and in mine the old man was long gratefully
remembered as Old Father Christmas.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span><h1>BENJY IN BEASTLAND.</h1></div>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A BAD BOY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Benjy</span> was a bad boy. His name was Benjamin, but he
was always called Benjy. He looked like something ending
in jy or gy, or rather dgy, such as <span class='it'>podgy</span>. Indeed he was
podgy, and moreover smudgy, having that cloudy, slovenly
look (like a slate <span class='it'>smudged</span> instead of washed) which is
characteristic of people whose morning toilet is not so
thorough as it should be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boys are very nice creatures. Far be it from us to think,
with some people, that they are nuisances to be endured as
best may be till they develop into men. An intelligent and
modest boy is one of the most charming of companions. As
to an obliging boy (that somewhat rare but not extinct animal),
there is hardly a limit to his powers of usefulness; or
anything—from emigrating to a desert island to cleaning
the kitchen clock—that one would not feel justified in undertaking
with his assistance, and free access to his pocket
stores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then boys’ wholesale powers of accumulation and destruction
render their dens convenient storehouses of generally
useless and particularly useful lumber. If you want string
or wire, or bottles or flower-pots, or a bird-cage, or an odd
glove or shoe, or anything of any kind to patch up something
of a similar kind, or missing property of your own or
another’s—go to a boy’s room! There one finds abundance
of everything, from cobbler’s wax to the carmine from one’s
own water-color box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(One is apt to recognize old acquaintances, and one occasionally
reclaims their company!)</p>

<p class='pindent'>All things are in a more or less serviceable condition, and
at the same time sufficiently damaged to warrant appropriation
to the needs of the moment. One suffers much loss at
boys’ hands from time to time, and it is trying to have dainty
feminine bowers despoiled of their treasures; but there are
occasions when one spoils the spoiler!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then what admirable field naturalists boys can make!
They are none the worse for nocturnal moth hunts, or for
wading up a stream for a Batrachosperma, or for standing
in a pond pressing recruits for the fresh-water aquarium.
A “collection” more or less is as nothing in the vast chaos
of their possessions, though some scrupulous sister might be
worried to find “a place for it.” And Fortune (capricious
dame!) is certainly fond of boys, and guides some
young “harum-scarum” to a <span class='it'>habitat</span> that has eluded the
spectacles of science. And their cuttings always grow!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then as to boys’ fun; within certain limits, there is no
rough-and-ready wit to be compared with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it is a pity that some boys bring a delightful class
into disrepute—boys who are neither intelligent, modest,
obliging, nor blest with cultivated tastes—boys who kick
animals, tease children, sneer at feminine society, and shirk
any company that is better than their own—boys, in short,
like Benjy, who at one period of his career did all this, and
who had a taste for low company, too, and something about
his general appearance which made you think how good for
him it would be if he could be well scrubbed with hot and
soft soap both inside and out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Benjy’s worst fault, <span class='it'>the</span> vice of his character, was
cruelty to animals. He was not merely cruel with the
thoughtless cruelty of childhood, nor with the cruelty
which is a secondary part of sport, nor with the occasional
cruelty of selfishness or ill-temper. But he had that taste
for torture, that pleasure in other creatures’ pain, which
does seem to be born with some boys. It is incomprehensible
by those who have never felt the hateful temptation, and
it certainly seems more like a fiendish characteristic than a
human infirmity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy was one of three children, and the only boy. He
had two little sisters, but they were younger than himself,
and he held them in supreme contempt. They were nice,
merry little things, and many boys (between teasing, petting,
patronizing, and making them useful) would have found
them companionable enough, at any rate for the holidays.
But Benjy, as I have said, liked low company, and a boy
with a taste for low company seldom cares for the society of
his sisters. Benjy thought games stupid; he never touched
his garden (though his sisters kept it religiously in order
during his absence at school); and as to natural history, or
reading, or any civilizing pursuit, such matters were not at
all in Benjy’s line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was proud of being patronized by Tom, the
coachman’s scapegrace son—a coarse, cruel, and uneducated
lad, whose ideas of “fun” Benjy unfortunately made his
own. With him he went to see pigs killed, helped to drown
supernumerary pups and kittens, and became learned in
dog-fights, cock-fights, rat-hunting, cat-hunting, and so
forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy’s father was an invalid, and he had no brothers, so
that he was without due control and companionship. His
own lack of nice pursuits made the excitement of cruelty an
acceptable amusement for his idleness, and he would have
thought it unmanly to be more scrupulous and tender-hearted
than the coachman’s son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The society of this youth did not tend to improve Benjy’s
manners, and indeed he was very awkward in the drawing-room.
But he was talkative enough in the stable, and
rather a hero amongst the village boys who stoned frogs by
the riverside, in the sweet days of early summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truly Benjy had little in common with those fair, grey-eyed,
demure little maidens, his sisters. As one of them
pathetically said, “Benjy does not care for us, you know,
because we are only girls, so we have taken Nox for our
brother.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>NOX,</h2>

<p class='noindent'>so called because he was (as poets say) “as black as night,”
was a big, curly dog, partly retriever and partly of Newfoundland
breed. He was altogether black, except his paws,
which were brown, and for a grey spot under his tail. Now
as the grey-eyed, gentle little sisters elected him for their
brother in the room of Benjy it is but fair to compare the
two together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy, to look at, was smudgy and slovenly, and not at
all handsome, for he hated tubs, and brushes, and soap, and
cold water, and he liked to lie late in a morning, and then
was apt to shuffle on his clothes and come down after very
imperfect ablutions, having forgotten to brush his teeth, and
with his hair still in dusky “cockatoos” from tossing about
in bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nox rose early, delighted in cold water, and had teeth
like ivory and hair as glossy as a raven’s wing; his face
beamed with intelligence and trustfulness, and his clear
brown eyes looked straight into yours when you spoke to
him, as if he would say, “Let my eyes speak for me, if you
please; I have not the pleasure of understanding your
language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy’s waistcoat and shirt-front were untidy and spotted
with dirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The covering of Nox’s broad chest was always glossy and
in good order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy came into the drawing room with muddy boots and
dirty hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nox, if he had been out in the mud, would lie down on
his return and lick his broad, soft, brown paws, like a cat,
till they were clean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been said that Benjy did not care for the society of
girls; but when Nox was petted by his lady-sisters, he put
his big head on their shoulders, and licked their faces with
his big red tongue (which was his way of kissing). And he
would put up his brown feet in the most insinuating manner,
and shake paws over and over again, pressing tightly
with his strong toes, but never hurting the little girls’
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy destroyed lives with much wanton cruelty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nox saved lives at the risk of his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ruling idea of his life, and what he evidently considered
his most important pursuit, in fact, his duty, or vocation,
must be described at some length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the dog’s home ran a broad deep river. Here one
could bathe and swim most delightfully. Here also many
an unfortunate animal found a watery grave. There was
one place from which (the water being deep and the bank
convenient at this spot) the poor wretches were generally
thrown. A good deal of refuse and worn-out articles of
various sorts also got flung in here, for at this point the river
skirted the back part of the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hither at early morning Nox would come, in conformity
with his own peculiar code of duty, which may be summed
up in these words: “<span class='it'>Whatever does not properly or naturally
belong to the water should be fetched out.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now near the River Seine, in Paris, there is a building
called the <span class='it'>Morgue</span>, where the bodies of the drowned are laid
out for recognition by their friends. There was no such
institution in the town where Nox lived, so he established a
Morgue for himself. Not far from the spot I have mentioned,
an old willow tree spread its branches widely over
the bank, and here and there stretched a long arm, and
touched the river with its pointed fingers. Under the
shadow of this tree was the Morgue, and here Nox brought
the bodies he rescued from the river and laid them down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I use the word bodies in its most scientific sense, for it
was not alone the bodies of men or animals that Nox felt
himself bound to reclaim. He would strive desperately for
the rescue of an old riding boot, the rung of a chair, a worn-out
hearthbrush, or anything obviously out of place in the
deep waters. Whatever the prize might be, when he had
successfully brought it ashore, he would toss his noble head,
arch his neck, paw with his forefeet, and twist and stick out
his curly back, as much as to say, “Will no one pat me as I
deserve?” Though he held his prize with all the delicacy
of his retriever instincts, he could seldom resist the temptation
to give it one proud shake, after which he would hurry
with it to the willow tree, as if conscious that it was high
time it should be properly attended to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There the mother whose child had fallen into the river,
and the mother whose child had thrown her broom into the
water, might come to reclaim their property, with equal
chances of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it is hardly needful to say that between Benjy and
Nox there was very little in common. And if there were
two things about Nox which Benjy disliked more than
others, they were his talent for rescue and the institution of
the Morgue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a reason for this. Benjy had more than once
been concerned in the death of animals belonging to other
people, and the owners had made an inconvenient fuss and
inquiry. In such circumstances Benjy and Tom were accustomed
to fasten a stone to the corpse and drop it into the
river, and thus, as they hoped, get rid of all testimony to
the true reason of the missing favorite’s disappearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of all the fallacies which shadow the half-truths of
popular proverbs, none is greater than that of the saying,
“Dead men tell no tales.” For, to begin with, the dead
body is generally the first witness to a murder, and that
despite the most careful hiding. And so the stones which
had been tied with hurried or nervous fingers were apt to
come off, and then the body of Neighbor Goodman’s spaniel,
or old Lady Dumble’s Angola cat, would float on the river,
and tell their own true and terrible tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even then the current might have favored Benjy, and
carried the corpses away, had it not been for Nox’s early
rounds whilst Benjy was still in bed, and for that hateful and
too notorious Morgue.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>MISTER ROUGH,</h2>

<p class='noindent'>was another dog belonging to Benjy’s father, and commonly
regarded as the property of Benjy himself. He was a wiry-haired
terrier, with clipped ears and tail, and a chain collar
that jingled as he trotted about on his bent legs. He was
of a grizzled brown color excepting his shirt-front, which
was white, and his toe-tips, which were like the light-colored
toes of woolen socks. His eyes had been scratched by cats—though
not quite out—his lean little body bore marks of
all kinds of rough usage, and his bark was hoarse from a
long imprisonment in a damp outhouse in winter. Much
training (to encounter rats and cats), hard usage, short
commons, and a general preponderance of kicks over halfpence
in his career had shortened his temper and his bark,
and caused both to be exhibited more often than would
probably have been the case in happier circumstances. He
had been characterized as “rough, tough, gruff, and up to
snuff,” and the description fitted well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Benjy had a kind feeling for any animal, it was for
Mister Rough, though it might more truly be called admiration.
And yet he treated him worse than Nox, to whom he
bore an unmitigated dislike. But Nox was a large dog and
could not be ill-treated with impunity. So Benjy feared him
and hated him doubly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to an animal too strong to be ill-used at all Benjy
disliked an animal too weak to be ill-used much or long.
Now as to this veteran Mister Rough, there was no saying
what he had not borne, and would not bear. He seemed to
absorb the nine lives of every cat he killed into his own
constitution, and only to grow leaner, tougher, more scarred,
more grizzled, and more “game” as time went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so there grew up in Benjy an admiration for his powers
of endurance which almost amounted to regard.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>MORE MISCHIEF.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Benjy</span> had got a bad fit on him. He was in a mood for
mischief. Perhaps he was not well; he certainly was intolerable
by all about him. He even ventured to play a trick
on Nox. Thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nox was a luxurious, comfort-loving old fellow, and after
a good deal of exercise in the fresh air he thoroughly enjoyed
the drowsy effect of a plentiful meal, a warm room, and a
comfortable hearth-rug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If anything in the events of the day had disturbed his
composure, or affected his feelings, how he talked it all over
to himself, with curious, expressive little noises, marvellously
like human speech, till by degrees the remarks came few and
far between, the velvety eyelids closed, and with one expressive
grunt Nox was asleep! But in a few moments, though
the handsome black body was at rest on the crimson sheep-skin
that was so becoming to his beauty, his—whatever you
please to allow in the shape of an “inner consciousness”—was
in the land of dreams. He was talking once more, this
time with short, muffled barks and whines, and twitching violently
with his legs. Perhaps he fancied himself accomplishing
a rescue. But a whistle from his master would pierce
his dream, and quiet without awaking him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his most luxurious moments he would roll on to his
back, and stretching his neck and his four legs to their uttermost,
would abandon himself to sleep and enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one of these occasions which Benjy chose for teasing
poor Nox. As he sat near him he kept lightly pricking
his sensitive lips with a fine needle. Nox would half awake,
shake his head, rub his lips with his paw in great disgust,
and finally drop off again. When he was fairly asleep,
Benjy recommenced, for he did dearly love to tease and torment,
and this evening he was in a restless, mischievous mood.
At last one prick was a little too severe; Nox jumped up
with a start, and the needle went deeply in, the top breaking
off with the jerk, but the remainder was fast in the flesh,
where his little sisters discovered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! how they wept for the sufferings of their pet! <span class='it'>They</span>
were not afraid of Nox, and had no scruple in handling the powerful
mouth whose sharp white teeth had so often pretended
to bite their hands, with a pretence as gentle as if they had
been made of eggshell. At last the braver of the two held
his lips and extracted the needle, whilst the other wiped the
tears from her sister’s eyes that she might see what she was
about. Nox himself sat still and moaned faintly, and wagged
his tail very feebly; but when the operation was over he
fairly knocked the little sisters down in his gratitude, and
licked their faces till he was out of breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he talked to himself for a full half-hour about the
injury, and who could have been the culprit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he fell asleep and dreamed of his enemy, and
growled at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Benjy went out and threw a stick at Mister Rough.
And when Mister Rough caught it he swung him by it violently
round and round. But Mister Rough’s teeth were
beginning to be the worse for wear, and at the fifth round he
lost his hold for the first time in his career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Benjy would have caught him to punish him, but
either unnerved by his failure, or suspicious of the wicked
look in Benjy’s eye, Mister Rough for the first time “feared
his fate,” and took to his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy could not find him, but he found Tom, who was
chasing a Scotch terrier with stones. So Benjy joined the
sport, which would have been very good fun, but that one of
the stones perversely hit the poor beast on the head, and put
an end to the chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that night a neighbor’s dog was lost, and there was
another corpse in the river.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>FROM THE MORGUE TO THE MOON.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Benjy</span> went to bed, but he could not sleep. He wished
he had not put that dog in the river—it would get him
into a scrape. He had been flogged for Mr. Goodman’s
spaniel, and though Mister Rough had been flogged for Lady
Dumble’s cat, Benjy knew on whose shoulders the flogging
should by rights have descended. Then Nox seemed all right,
in spite of the needle, and would no doubt pursue his officious
charities with sunrise. Benjy could not trust himself to get
up early in the morning, but he could go out that night, and
he would—with a hayfork—and get the body out of the
water, and hide or bury it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Benjy came to the river-side a sort of fascination
drew him to the Morgue. What if the body were already
there! But it was not. There were only a kitten, part of
an old basket, and the roller of a jack-towel. And when
Benjy looked up into the willow, the moon was looking down
at him through the forked limbs of the tree, and it looked so
large and so near, that Benjy thought that if he were sitting
upon a certain branch he could touch it with his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he bethought him of a book which had been his
mother’s and now belonged to his sisters, in which it was
amusingly pretended that dogs went to the moon after their
existence on earth was over. The book had a frontispiece
representing the dogs sitting in the moon and relating their
former experiences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be odd if the one we killed last were up there
now,” said Benjy to himself. And he fancied that as he said
it the man in the moon winked at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if it is really true,” said Benjy, aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly,” said the man in the moon, “but something
like it. This is Beastland. Won’t you come up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I never did!” cried Benjy, whose English was not
of the refined order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you have,” said the man in the moon, waggishly.
“Now, are you coming up? But perhaps you can’t
climb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t I?” said Benjy, and in three minutes he was on
the branch, and close to the moon. The higher he climbed
the larger the moon looked, till it was like the biggest disc of
light ever thrown by a magic lantern, and when he was fairly
seated on the branch close by, he could see nothing but a
blaze of white light all round him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk boldly in,” he heard the man in the moon say.
“Put out your feet, and don’t be afraid; it’s not so bright inside.”
So Benjy put his feet down, and dropped, and thought
he was certainly falling into the river. But he only fell
upon his feet, and found himself in Beastland. It was an odd
place, truly!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Cerberus guarded the entrance to Pluto’s domains, so
there sat at the going in to Beastland a black dog—the very
black dog who gets on to sulky children’s backs. And on
the back of the black dog sat a crow—the crow that people
pluck when they quarrel; and though it has been plucked so
often it has never been plucked bare, but is in very good
feather yet, unfortunately. And in a field behind was an
Irish bull, a mad bull, but quite harmless. The old cow
was there too, but not the tune she died of, for being still
popular on earth, it could not be spared. Near these the
nightmare was grazing, and in a corner of the field was the
mare’s nest, on which sat a round-robin, hatching plots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And about the mare’s nest flew a tell-tale-tit—the little
bird who tells tales and carries news. And it has neither
rest nor nest of its own, for gossips are always gadding, and
mischief is always being made. And in a cat’s cradle swung
from the sky slept the cat who washes the dishes, with a
clean dishcloth under her head, ready to go down by the first
sunbeam to her work. Whilst the bee that gets into Scotchmen’s
bonnets went buzzing restlessly up and down with
nothing to do, for all the lunatics in North Britain happened
to be asleep that evening. And on the head of the
right nail hung a fancy portrait of the cat who “does it,”
when careless or dishonest servants waste and destroy things.
I need hardly say that the cat could not be there herself,
because (like Mrs. Gamp’s friend, Mrs. Harris) “there ain’t
no such a person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy stared about him for a bit, and then he began to
feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the man in the moon?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone to Norwich,” said the tell-tale-tit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you anything to say against that?” asked the
crow. “Caw, caw, caw! pluck me, if you dare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very odd,” thought Benjy; “but I’ll go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black dog growled, but let him pass; the bee buzzed
about, and the cat in the cradle swung and slept serenely
through it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should get on quicker if I rode instead of walking,”
thought Benjy; so he went up to the nightmare and asked
if she would carry him a few miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be the victim of a very singular delusion,”
said the nightmare, coolly. “It is for me to be carried by
you, not for you to ride on me.” And as Benjy looked, her
nose grew longer and longer, and her eyes were so hideous,
they took Benjy’s breath away; and he fled as fast as his
legs would carry him. And so he got deep, deep into
Beastland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! it was a beautiful place. There were many more
beasts than there are in the Zoölogical Garden; and they
were all free. They did not devour each other, for a
peculiar kind of short grass grew all over Beastland, which
was eaten by all alike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If by chance there were any quarrelling, or symptoms of
misbehavior, the man in the moon would cry “Manners!”
and all was quiet at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talking of manners, the civility of the beasts in Beastland
was most conspicuous. They came in crowds and welcomed
Benjy, each after his own fashion. The cats rubbed their
heads against his legs and held their tails erect, as if they
were presenting arms. The dogs wagged theirs, and barked
and capered round him; except one French poodle, who
“sat up” during the whole visit, as an act of politeness. The
little birds sang and chirruped. The pigeons sat on his
shoulders and cooed; two little swallows clung to the eaves
of his hat, and twitched their tails, and said “Kiwit! kiwit!”
A peacock with a spread tail went before him; and a flock
of rose-colored cockatoos brought up the rear. Presently a
wise and solemn old elephant came and knelt before Benjy;
and Benjy got on to his back and rode in triumph, the other
beasts following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us show him the lions!” cried all the beasts, and on
they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Benjy found that they meant real lions—like
the lions in a menagerie, but not in cages—he was frightened,
and would not go on. And he explained that by the
“lions” of a place <span class='it'>he</span> meant the “sights” that are exhibited
to strangers, whether natural curiosities or local manufactures.
When the beasts understood this, they were most
anxious to show him “lions” of his own kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the wise-eyed beavers, whose black faces were as
glossy as that of Nox, took him to their lodges, and showed
him how they fell or collect wood “up stream” with their
sharp teeth, and so float it down to the spot where they have
decided to build, as the “logs” from American forests float
down the rivers in spring. And as they displayed the wonderous
forethought and ingenuity of their common dwellings,
a little caddis worm, in the water hard by, begged Benjy to
observe that, on a smaller scale, his own house bore witness
to similar patience and skill, with its rubble walls of motley
variety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another stream a doughty little stickleback sailing
round and round the barrel-shaped nest, over which he was
keeping watch, displayed its construction with pardonable
pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Benjy saw, with an interest it was impossible not to
feel, the wonderful galleries in the earth cities of the ants;
the nest of the large hornet, the wasp, and the earwig, where
hive as well as comb is the work of the industrious proprietors;
and whilst he was looking at these, a message
came from three patches of lepraliæ on the back of an old
oyster-shell by the sea, to beg that Benjy would come and see
their dwelling, where the cells were not of one uniform
pattern, but in all varieties of exquisite shapes, each tribe or
family having its own proper style of architecture. And it
must not be supposed that, because lepralæ cells can only be
seen under a microscope with us, that it was so in Beastland;
for there all the labors and exquisite performances of every
small animal were equally manifest to sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But invitations came in fast. The “social grosbecks” requested
him to visit their city of nests in a distant wood; the
“prairie dogs” wished to welcome him to their village of
mounds, where each dog, sitting on his own little hut, eagerly
awaited the honor of his visit. The rooks bade him to a
solemn conference; and a sentinel was posted on every
alternate tree, up to the place of meeting, to give notice of
his approach. A spider (looking very like some little, old,
hard-headed, wizen-faced, mechanical genius!) was really
anxious to teach Benjy to make webs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” said he; “we will suppose that you are
ready and about to begin. Well. You look—anywhere, in
fact—down into space, and decide to what point you wish to
affix your first line. Then—you have a ball of thread in
your inside, of course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say that I have,” said Benjy; “but I have a
good deal of string in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” said the spider; “I call it thread;
you call it string. Pocket or stomach, it’s all the same, I
suppose. Well——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just as the spider was at the crisis of his lesson, and
all was going on most pleasantly—whizz!—the tell-tale-tit
made its appearance, and soon whispered, first to one animal
and then to another, who and what Benjy was. The effect
was magical. “Scandalous!” cried all the beasts; “the
monster!” An old tabby cat puffed out her tail, and ran up
a tree. “Boy!” she exclaimed, in a tone of the deepest
disgust; for in Beastland they say “boy” as a term of reproach
where we should say “beast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The confusion was great, and the tell-tale-tit revelled in it,
hopping and flitting about, and adding a word here or there if
the excitement seemed to flag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think what he might do to us, if we were down
yonder!” cried an old pug. (She was a great-grand-mother
and so fat that she could hardly waddle.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is in <span class='it'>your</span> power up here, you know,” said the tell-tale-tit,
suggestively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he is!” cried the beasts; and with one voice they
shouted—“Punishment! Punishment! Bring him to the
lion!” And to the lion he was brought, the beasts still crying,
“Punishment! Punishment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll punish him!” cried a donkey, who trotted up on hearing
of the matter. “Let me get a lump of cold iron between
his teeth, and tug and jerk it against the corners of his
mouth. Let me pull in and flog at the same moment. Let
me knock him over the head, and kick him in the ribs, and
thwack his back, and prod his side; and I’ll soon make him
run, and take his nasty temper out of him, and teach him to
carry any weight, and go gaily in harness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gently, gently, my friend,” said the lion. “You speak
under a very natural feeling of irritation; but if I am
to be judge of this case, the prisoner must have fair
play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly the beasts placed themselves in a sort of
circle, Benjy being put in the middle; and a bull-frog who
lived in a ditch hard by was appointed to watch the case on
his behalf. The bull-frog had big, watchful eyes, and was
cool and cautious. As the case proceeded he occasionally said
“Omph!” which sounded thoughtful, and committed him to
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the prisoner accused of?” asked the lion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this question everybody looked round for the tell-tale-tit;
but, like most mischief-makers, the good gossip liked
nothing less than being brought to book, and had taken advantage
of the confusion to fly away. So the other animals
had to recall what they had heard as best they might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ill-uses and drowns dogs, hunts and kills cats——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rough kills the cats,” interrupted Benjy, for he was becoming
alarmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Omph!” said the bull-frog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send for Mr. Rough,” said the lion; and a messenger
was despatched. (It is not always needful to disturb yourself,
dear reader, when your pet dog is absent without
leave: he may have gone on business to Beastland.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cock-a-doodle-do! Flap, flap! send for more whilst
you are about it,” cried a handsome gamecock, strutting into
the midst. “Cock-a-doodle-do! when I crow, let no other
cock open his beak. There’s a nice-cock-fighting, good-for-nothing
young scapegrace! I know a pullet of the same breed
down yonder: his name is Tom. Let him be fetched up, and
we will fasten spurs to their heels, and set them to kick each
other and tear each other’s eyes out. It will be rare sport,
and sport is a noble taste, and should be encouraged. Flap,
flap! cock-a-doodle-do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cock was just stretched on his tiptoes, in the act of
crowing, when a pattering of feet and the jingling of a chain
collar was heard, and Mister Rough trotted brusquely into
the circle, with his clipped ears and his stumpy tail erect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister Rough,” said the lion; “the prisoner says it is
you and not he who torment the cats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bowf, bowf, bowf!” replied the terrier, jumping wildly
about in his stocking feet. “Whose fault is it? Wowf, wowf,
wowf who taught me to do it? Bowf, wowf! that bad boy there.
Rowf, rowf! let me get hold of him by the small of the back,
and I’ll shake him as I would shake a rat. Rowf, wowf,
bowf!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Manners!</span>” cried the man in the moon, and there was
silence at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he has not gone to Norwich, after all!” said Benjy
to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a short pause the examination was resumed. Mister
Rough deposed that he hunted cats by the teaching and imperative
orders of Benjy and other human beings. That he
could not now see a cat without a feeling which he could only
describe as madness seizing him, which obliged him to chase
and despatch puss without any delay. He never felt this
sensation towards the cat of his own house, in her own
kitchen. They were quite friendly, and ate from the same
dish. In cross examination he admitted that he had a
natural taste for tearing things, and preferred fur to any
other material. But he affirmed that an occasional slipper
or other article would have served the purpose, but for his
unfortunate education, especially if the slipper or other
article were hairy or trimmed with fur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But all that is as nothing,” cried the old tabby, indignantly;
“he has been guilty of the most horrible cruelties,
and they ought to be paid back to him in kind. Sss, spt, he’s
a boy, I say, a regular boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Omph!” said the bull-frog, and went below to consider
the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlebeasts,” said the lion, “I consider it unnecessary
to hear more evidences against the prisoner, especially as no
attempt is made to deny his cruelties, though in the matter
of cat-hunting he implicates Mister Rough. There are not
two opinions as to his guilt; the only open question is that
of punishment. As you have placed the matter in my hands,
I will beg you to wait until I have taken three turns and given
the subject my serious consideration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But instead of three turns the lion took seven, pacing
majestically round and round, and now and then lashing his
tail. At last he resumed his seat; the bull-frog put his green
head up again, and the lion gave judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlebeasts, birds, and fishes, I have given this subject
my most serious consideration, and I trust that my decision
will not give offense. Our friend, Madame Tabby, declares
that the prisoner should be punished with a like cruelty to
that which he has inflicted. Friend Donkey is ready to ride
or drive him with all the kicking, beating, and pulling which
soured his own temper, and stunted his faculties in their early
development. I must frankly roar that I am not in favor of
this. My friends, let us not degrade ourselves to the level of
men. We know what they are. Too often stupid in their
kindness, vindictive in their anger, and not seldom wantonly
cruel. Is this our character as a class? Do we even commonly
retaliate? Ask friend Donkey himself. Does the
treatment (even more irrational than unkind) which blunts
the intelligence, and twists the temper of so many of his race,
prevent their rendering on the whole the largest labor for
the roughest usage of any servant of man? Need I speak of
dogs? Do they bear malice towards a harsh master? Are
they unfaithful because he is unkind? Would Mister Rough
himself permit any one to touch an article of his master’s
property, or grudge his own life in his defense? No, my
friends, we are beasts, remember—not boys. We have our
own ideas of chase and sport, like men; but cruelty is not
one of our vices. I believe, gentlebeasts, that it is a principle
with the human race to return good for evil; but according
to my experience the practice is more common amongst
ourselves. Gentlebeasts, we <span class='it'>cannot</span> treat this boy as he has
treated us: but he is unworthy of our society, and I condemn
him to be expelled. Some of our dog-friends have taken
refuge here with tin-kettles at their tails. Let one of these
be fastened to Benjy, and let him be chased from Beastland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was no sooner said than done. And with an old tin
pan cutting his heels at every step, Benjy was hunted from
the moon. The lion gave one terrific roar as the signal for
starting, and all the beasts, with Mister Rough at their head,
gave chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dear readers, did you ever wonder—as I used to wonder—if
one could get to the end of the world <span class='it'>and jump off</span>?
One is bound to confess that, as regards our old earth, it is
not feasible; but permit me (in a story) to state that Benjy
ran and ran till he got to the end of the moon and jumped
off, Mister Rough jumping after him. Down, down they
went through space; past the Great Bear (where were all
the ghosts of the big wild beasts); past the Little Bear
(where were the ghosts of all the small wild beasts); close
by the Dog Star, where good dogs go to when they die, and
where “the dog in the manger” sat outside and must never
go in till all the dogs are assembled. This they passed so
close that they could see the dog of Montargis and the hound
Gelert affably licking each other’s noses, and telling stories
of old times to the latest comer. This was a white poodle,
whose days on earth had been prolonged by tender care till
he outlived almost every faculty and sense but the power to
eat, and a strange intuitive knowledge of his master’s presence,
surviving every other instinct. There he sat now, no
longer the blind, deaf, feeble, shrunken heap of bones and
matted wool, that died of sheer old age, and was buried on
the garden side of the church-yard wall, as near as permissible
to the family vault; but the snowy, fluffy, elegant poodle of
his youth, with graceful ears raised in respectful attention to
the hero of Montargis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down, down they went, on, on! How far and long it
seemed! And now it was no longer night but morning, and
the sun shone, and still they went on, on, down, down:
Benjy crying “Oh! oh!” and Rough and his chain collar
going “Bowf, wowf, jingle, jingle,” till they came close
above the river, and before Benjy could give an extra shriek
the two were floundering in the water. Rough soon swam
ashore, but Benjy could not swim, and the water sucked him
down as it had sucked down many a dog in that very spot.
Then Benjy choked, and gasped, and struggled as his victims
had so often choked, and gasped, and struggled under his
eyes. And he fought with the intolerable suffocation till it
seemed as if his head must burst, yet he could not cry out,
for the cold water gagged him. Then he grasped at something
that floated by, but it gave him no help, for it was a
dead dog—the one he had thrown into the river the evening
before. And horror chilled him more than the cold water had
done, as he thought that now he himself must be drowned,
and rot among these ghastly relics of his cruelty. And a
rook on a tree hard by cried, “Serve him right! serve him
right!” whilst the frogs on the river’s brink sat staring at
the crushed bodies of their relatives, and croaked, “Stone
him! stone him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pike hovering near could owe him no grudge, for the
creatures he had drowned had afforded it many a meal. But,
like most accomplices, the pike was selfish, and only waited
for the time when it could eat Benjy too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, some one on the bank was giving short barks,
like minute guns of distress, that had quite a different
meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Benjy sank; and as he went down the remembrance
of all his cruelties rushed over his mind, as the water
rushed over his body. All, from the first bumble-bee he
had tortured, to the needle in Nox’s lip, came together in
one hideous crowd to his remembrance, till even the callous
soul of Benjy sickened, and he loathed himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now he rose again for a moment to the surface, and
caught a breath of air, and saw the blue sky, and heard a
corn-crake in the field where his sisters had wanted him to
go cowslip-gathering; and he fancied that he saw the beautiful
black head of Nox also in the water, and found himself
saying in his heart, “No, no! thank <span class='sc'>God</span> I didn’t kill <span class='it'>him</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he sank again. And he thought of his home,
and his father and mother, and the little sisters whom he had
teased; and how he had got them into scrapes, and killed
their pets, and laughed at their tears. And he remembered
how they had come to meet him last midsummer holidays,
with flowers in their hats and flowers round the donkey’s
ears; and how he had prodded poor Neddy with a stick
having a sliding spike, which he had brought with him.
And what fun he had found in the starts of the donkey and
the terror and astonishment of the children. Oh! how
often had he not skulked from the society of these good and
dear ones, to be proud of being noticed and instructed in
evil by some untaught village blackguard! And then he
thought of the cosy bed and his mother’s nightly blessing,
never more to be his, who must now lie amongst dead dogs
as if he himself were such another!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he rose again, and there was the noble head of
old Nox not three feet from him. He could see the clear
brown eyes fixed eagerly upon him, and he thought, “He is
coming to revenge himself on me.” But he did not mind,
for he was almost past feeling any new pain. Only he gave
one longing, wistful look towards the home that had been
his. And as he looked a lark rose and went up into the
summer sky. And as the lark went, up, up, Benjy went
down, down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now as he sank there came into his mind a memory of
something he had once read, comparing the return of a
Christian soul to <span class='sc'>God</span> to the soaring of a lark into the
heavens. And no animal that he had seized in his pitiless
grasp ever felt such despair and helplessness as Benjy felt
when the strong, pitiless thought seized his soul that though
his body might decay among dead dogs, he could not die as
the dogs had died—irresponsible for the use of life. And
many a sin, besides sins of cruelty came back to poor Benjy’s
mind—known sins, for which he had been punished, but not
penitent; sins that were known to no human being but himself,
and sins, that he had forgotten until now. And he remembered
one day at school, when the head master had
given some serious warnings and advice to himself and a
few other boys in private. And how he had sat mum and
meek, with his smudgy and secretive face, till the old doctor
had departed, and how he had then delivered a not very
clever mimic address in the doctor’s style, to the effectual
dissipation of all serious thought. And now—opportunities,
advice, and time of amendment were all but gone, and what
had he to look forward to? From the depths of his breaking
heart Benjy prayed he might somehow or other be spared
to do better. And for the third and last time he rose to the
surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lark was almost out of sight; but close to Benjy’s
pallid face was a soft black nose, and large brown eyes met
his with an expression neither revengeful nor affectionate.
It was business-like, earnest, and somewhat eager and proud.
And then the soft, sensitive mouth he had wounded seized
Benjy with a hold as firm and as gentle as if he had been a
rare water-fowl, and Nox paddled himself round with his
broad, brown paws, and made gallantly for shore. Benjy
was much heavier than a dead cat, and the big brave beast
had hard work of it; so that by the time he had dragged the
body to land, Nox was too far spent to toss his head and
carry his prize about as usual. He dropped Benjy, and lay
down by him, with one paw on the body, as much as to say,
“Let no unauthorized person meddle in this matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he had rested, he took up Benjy in his mouth,
and—not deigning so much as a glance in the direction of
some men who were shouting and running towards him—he
trotted with his burden to the Morgue under the willow
tree, where he laid Benjy down side by side with two dead
dogs, a kitten, and an old hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After which he shook himself, and went home to breakfast.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>WHAT BECAME OF BENJY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Benjy</span> was duly found under the willow tree, and taken
home. For a long time he was very ill, though at last he
recovered; and I am bound to state that some of his relatives
consider his visit to Beastland to be entirely mythical.
They believe that he fell from the willow tree into the water,
and that his visit to the moon is a fanciful conceit woven
during illness by his fevered brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However that may be, Benjy and beasts were thenceforward
on very different terms. Some other causes may have
helped towards this. Perhaps when the boys of a family
are naturally disagreeable, the fact is apt to be too readily
acquiesced in. They have a license which no one would
dream of according to “the girls,” but it may sometimes be
too readily decided that “boys will be boys,” in the most
obnoxious sense of the phrase, and a “bad name” is unfavorable
to them as well as to dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, during long weeks of convalescence, Benjy’s only
companions were his parents and the little sisters whose
sympathy with beastkind had always been in such manifest
contrast with his own tastes. And as the little maids could
only amuse him with their own amusements, and as, moreover,
there is no occupation so soothing, healing, and renovating
to mind and body, so full of interest without hurtful
excitement, as the study of Nature, it came about that
Benjy’s sick-room was so decorated with plants, aquariums,
and so forth, that it became a sort of miniature Beastland.
From watching his sisters, Benjy took to feeding the fresh-water
beasts himself; and at last became so tenderly interested
in their fate, that he privately “tipped” the house-maid
with his last half-crown, to induce her to come up the
stairs in the morning with great circumspection. For the
cray-fish was given to escaping from his tank for an early
stroll, and had once been all but trodden on at the bottom
of the first flight of stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was a very sad event which finally and fully softened
Benjy’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Benjy was being carried into the house after his accident,
Mister Rough caught sight of his master in this doleful
position, and was anxious to follow and see what became
of him. But as he was in the way, a servant was ordered to
fasten him up in his own out-house; and to this man’s care
he was confided through Benjy’s illness. The little girls
often asked after him, and received satisfactory reports of
his health, but as the terrier’s temper was supposed to be less
trustworthy than that of Nox, they were not allowed to play
with him, or take him out with them. Hence it came about
that he was a good deal neglected at this time, Benjy’s parents
being so absorbed by the anxiety of his illness, and the
sisters not being allowed to make the dog their companion.
Once or twice the servant took him out for a run; but Mister
Rough would not take a proper “constitutional.” The
instant he was free, he fled to the house to see what had become
of Benjy. As he did this every time, and it was inconvenient,
the servant finally left him alone, and did not
take him out at all. Food was put within his reach, but
Mister Rough’s appetite failed daily. A cat crept in under
the roof and looked at her old enemy with impunity. A rat
stole his crusts; and Mister Rough never moved his eyes
nor his nose from the opening under the barn-door. Oh, for
one sniff of Benjy passing by! Oh, to be swung round a
dozen times by the teeth or tail! Oh, for a kicking, a
thrashing—for <span class='it'>anything</span> from Benjy! So the gentle heart
within that rough little body pined day by day in its loving
anxiety for a harsh master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the first time that Benjy came downstairs he begged
that Mister Rough might be brought into the drawing-room;
for, as I have said, if he had a regard for any animal, it was
for the wiry terrier. So the servant opened the barn-door;
and Mister Rough thought of Benjy, and darted into the
house. And when he got into the front hall, he smelt
Benjy, and ran into the drawing-room; and when he got
into the drawing-room, he saw Benjy, who had heard the
jingle of his collar, and stood up to receive him with outstretched
arms. Then with one wild sound, that was neither
a bark nor a whine, Mister Rough sprang to Benjy’s arms,
and fell at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dead? Yes dead; with one spasm of unspeakable joy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benjy’s grief for his faithful friend was not favorable to
his bodily health just then, but it was good for him in other
ways. And as the bitter tears poured over his cheeks and
dropped on to the scarred, grizzled little face that could feel
cruelty or kindness no more, the smudginess seemed to be
washed away from him body and soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, in spite of all past sins, Benjy lived to amend, and to
become, eventually, a first-rate naturalist and a good friend
to beasts. For there is no doubt that some most objectionable
boys do get scrubbed, and softened, and ennobled into
superior men. And Benjy was one of these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time he was thoroughly strong again, he and his
little sisters had a common interest in the animals under their
care—their own private Beastland. He tried to pet another
terrier, but in vain. So the new “Rough” was given to the
sisters, and Benjy adopted Nox. For he said, “I should
like a dog who knew Mister Rough;” and, “If Nox likes,
me in spite of old times, I shall believe I am fit to keep a
pet.” And no one who knows dogs needs to be told that not
the ghost of a bit of malice lessened the love which the benevolent
retriever bore to his new master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The savings of Benjy’s pocket-money for some time were
expended on a tombstone for the terrier’s grave, with this
inscription:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>TO A FAITHFUL FRIEND,</p>

<p class='line'>ON HIS MASTER’S RECOVERY FROM SICKNESS.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And that true and tender beast, who bore so much hard
usage for so long, but died of his one great happiness——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dear reader, do you not think he is in the Dog Star?</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span><h1>THE PEACE-EGG.</h1></div>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A CHRISTMAS TALE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Every</span> one ought to be happy at Christmas. But there
are many things which ought to be, and yet are not; and
people are sometimes sad even in the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain and his wife were sad, though it was Christmas
Eve. Sad, though they were in the prime of life,
blessed with good health, devoted to each other and to their
children, with competent means, a comfortable house on a
little freehold property of their own, and, one might say,
everything the heart could desire. Sad, though they were
good people, whose peace of mind had a firmer foundation
than their earthly goods alone; contented people, too, with
plenty of occupation for mind and body. Sad—and in the
nursery this was held to be past all reason—though the
children were performing that ancient and most entertaining
play or Christmas mystery of Good St. George of England,
known as <span class='it'>The Peace-Egg</span>, for their benefit and behoof alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The play was none the worse that most of the actors were
too young to learn parts, so that there was very little of the
rather tedious dialogue, only plenty of dress and ribbons, and
of fighting with the wooden swords. But though St. George
looked bonny enough to warm any father’s heart, as he
marched up and down with an air learned by watching many
a parade in barrack-square and drill-ground, and though the
Valiant Slasher did not cry in spite of falling hard and the
Doctor treading accidentally on his little finger in picking
him up, still the Captain and his wife sighed nearly as often
as they smiled, and the mother dropped tears as well as pennies
into the cap which the King of Egypt brought round
after the performance.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CAPTAIN’S WIFE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Many</span> many years back the Captain’s wife had been a child
herself, and had laughed to see the village mummers act the
Peace-Egg, and had been quite happy on Christmas Eve.
Happy, though she had no mother. Happy, though her
father was a stern man, very fond of his only child, but with
an obstinate will that not even she dared thwart. She had
lived to thwart it, and he had never forgiven her. It was
when she married the Captain. The old man had a prejudice
against soldiers which was quite reason enough, in his
opinion, for his daughter to sacrifice the happiness of her
future life by giving up the soldier she loved. At last he
gave her her choice between the Captain and his own favor
and money. She chose the Captain, and was disowned and
disinherited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain bore a high character, and was a good and
clever officer, but that went for nothing against the old man’s
whim. He made a very good husband, too; but even this
did not move his father-in-law, who had never held any intercourse
with him or his wife since the day of their marriage,
and who had never seen his own grandchildren. Though not
so bitterly prejudiced as the old father, the Captain’s wife’s
friends had their doubts about the marriage. The place was
not a military station, and they were quiet country folk who
knew very little about soldiers, whilst what they imagined
was not altogether favorable to “red-coats,” as they called
them. Soldiers are well-looking generally, it is true (and the
Captain was more than well-looking—he was handsome);
brave, of course, it is their business (and the Captain had
V.C. after his name and several bits of ribbon on his patrol
jacket). But then, thought the good people, they are here
to-day and gone to-morrow, you “never know where you
have them;” they are probably in debt, possibly married to
several women in several foreign countries, and, though they
are very courteous in society, who knows how they treat their
wives when they drag them off from their natural friends and
protectors to distant lands where no one can call them to
account?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, poor thing!” said Mrs. John Bull, junior, as she took
off her husband’s coat on his return from business, a week
after the Captain’s wedding, “I wonder how she feels?
There’s no doubt the old man behaved disgracefully; but it’s
a great risk marrying a soldier. It stands to reason, military
men aren’t domestic; and I wish—Lucy Jane, fetch your
papa’s slippers, quick!—she’d had the sense to settle down
comfortably amongst her friends with a man who would have
taken care of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Officers are a wild set, I expect,” said Mr. Bull, complacently,
as he stretched his limbs in his own particular arm-chair,
into which no member of his family ever intruded.
“But the red-coats carry the day with plenty of girls who
ought to know better. You women are always caught by a
bit of finery. However, there’s no use our bothering <span class='it'>our</span>
heads about it. As she has brewed she must bake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain’s wife’s baking was lighter and more palatable
than her friends believed. The Captain (who took off
his own coat when he came home, and never wore slippers
but in his dressing-room) was domestic enough. A selfish
companion must, doubtless, be a great trial amid the hardships
of military life, but when a soldier is kind-hearted he is
often a much more helpful and thoughtful and handy husband
than an equally well-meaning civilian. Amid the ups and
downs of their wanderings, the discomforts of shipboard and
of stations in the colonies, bad servants, and unwonted sicknesses,
the Captain’s tenderness never failed. If the life was
rough the Captain was ready. He had been, by turns, in one
strait or another, sick-nurse, doctor, carpenter, nurse-maid,
and cook to his family, and had, moreover, an idea that nobody
filled these offices quite so well as himself. Withal, his
very profession kept him neat, well-dressed, and active. In
the roughest of their ever-changing quarters he was a
smarter man, more like the lover of his wife’s young days,
than Mr. Bull amid his stationary comforts. Then if the
Captain’s wife was—as her friends said—“never settled,”
she was also for ever entertained by new scenes; and domestic
mischances do not weigh very heavily on people whose
possessions are few and their intellectual interests many. It
is true that there were ladies in the Captain’s regiment who
passed by sea and land from one quarter of the globe to
another, amid strange climates and customs, strange trees
and flowers, beasts and birds; from the glittering snows of
North America to the orchids of the Cape, from beautiful
Pera to the lily-covered hills of Japan, and who in no place
rose above the fret of domestic worries, and had little to tell
on their return but of the universal misconduct of servants,
from Irish “helps” in the colonies, to <span class='it'>compradors</span> and China-boys
at Shanghai. But it was not so with the Captain’s wife.
Moreover, one becomes accustomed to one’s fate, and she
moved her whole establishment from the Curragh to Corfu
with less anxiety than that felt by Mrs. Bull over a port-wine
stain on the best table-cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, as years went and children came, the Captain
and his wife grew tired of travelling. New scenes were
small comfort when they heard of the death of old
friends. One foot of murky English sky was dearer,
after all, than miles of the unclouded heavens of the
South. The gray hills and over-grown lanes of her old
home haunted the Captain’s wife by night and day, and
home-sickness (that weariest of all sicknesses) began to
take the light out of her eyes before their time. It
preyed upon the Captain too. Now and then he would
say, fretfully, “<span class='it'>I should</span> like an English resting-place,
however small, before <span class='it'>everybody</span> is dead! But the children’s
prospects have to be considered.” The continued
estrangement from the old man was an abiding sorrow
also, and they had hopes that, if only they could
get to England, he might be persuaded to peace and charity
this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they were sent home. But the hard old father
still would not relent. He returned their letters unopened.
This bitter disappointment made the Captain’s wife so ill
that she almost died, and in one month the Captain’s hair
became an iron gray. He reproached himself for having
ever taken the daughter from her father, “to kill her at
last,” as he said. And (thinking of his own children) he
even reproached himself for having robbed the old widower
of his only child. After two years at home his regiment
was ordered to India. He failed to effect an exchange,
and they prepared to move once more—from Chatham to
Calcutta. Never before had the packing to which she was
so well accustomed been so bitter a task to the Captain’s
wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the darkest hour of this gloomy time that the
Captain came in, waving above his head a letter which
changed all their plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now close by the old home of the Captain’s wife there
had lived a man, much older than herself, who yet had
loved her with a devotion as great as that of the young
Captain. She never knew it, for when he saw that she
had given her heart to his younger rival, he kept silence,
and he never asked for what he knew he might have had—the
old man’s authority in his favor. So generous was the
affection which he could never conquer, that he constantly
tried to reconcile the father to his children whilst he lived,
and, when he died, he bequeathed his house and small estate
to the woman he had loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be a legacy of peace,” he thought, on his death-bed.
“The old man cannot hold out when she and her
children are constantly in sight. And it may please <span class='sc'>God</span>
that I shall know of the reunion I have not been permitted
to see with my eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus it came about that the Captain’s regiment went
to India without him, and that the Captain’s wife and her
father lived on opposite sides of the same road.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>MASTER ROBERT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> eldest of the Captain’s children was a boy. He was
named Robert, after his grandfather, and seemed to have
inherited a good deal of the old gentleman’s character,
mixed with gentler traits. He was a fair, fine boy, tall and
stout for his age, with the Captain’s regular features, and
(he flattered himself) the Captain’s firm step and martial
bearing. He was apt—like his grandfather—to hold his
own will to be other people’s law, and (happily for the peace
of the nursery) this opinion was devoutly shared by his
brother Nicholas. Though the Captain had sold his commission,
Robin continued to command an irregular force
of volunteers in the nursery, and never was Colonel more
despotic. His brothers and sisters were by turns infantry,
cavalry, engineers, and artillery, according to his whim, and
when his affections finally settled upon the Highlanders of
“The Black Watch,” no female power could compel him to
keep his stockings above his knees or his knickerbockers
below them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain alone was a match for his strong-willed
son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, sir,” said Sarah, one morning, flouncing
in upon the Captain, just as he was about to start for the
neighboring town,—“If you please, sir, I wish you’d speak
to Master Robert. He’s past my powers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no doubt of it,” thought the Captain, but he only
said, “Well, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Night after night do I put him to bed,” said Sarah,
“and night after night does he get up as soon as I’m out
of the room, and says he’s orderly officer for the evening,
and goes about in his night-shirt and his feet as bare as
boards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain fingered his heavy moustache to hide a smile,
but he listened patiently to Sarah’s complaints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t so much <span class='it'>him</span> I should mind, sir,” she continued,
“but he goes round the beds and wakes up the other young
gentlemen and Miss Dora, one after another, and when I
speak to him, he gives me all the sauce he can lay his tongue
to, and says he’s going round the guards. The other night
I tried to put him back into his bed, but he got away and
ran all over the house, me hunting him everywhere, and
not a sign of him till he jumps out on me from the garret-stairs
and nearly knocks me down. ‘I’ve visited the outposts,
Sarah,’ says he; ‘all’s well.’ And off he goes to bed
as bold as brass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you spoken to your mistress?” asked the
Captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said Sarah. “And missis spoke to him, and
he promised not to go round the guards again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he broken his promise?” asked the Captain, with a
look of anger, and also of surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I opened the door last night, sir,” continued
Sarah, in her shrill treble, “what should I see in the dark
but Master Robert a-walking up and down with the carpet-brush
stuck in his arm. ‘Who goes there?’ says he. ‘You
owdacious boy!’ says I, ‘Didn’t you promise your ma you’d
leave off them tricks?’ ‘I’m not going round the guards,’
says he; ‘I promised not. But I’m for sentry duty to-night.’
And say what I would to him, all he had for me
was, ‘You mustn’t speak to a sentry on duty.’ So I says,
‘As sure as I live till morning, I’ll go to your pa,’ for he
pays no more attention to his ma than to me, nor to any one
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please to see that the chair-bed in my dressing-room is
moved into your mistress’s bed-room,” said the Captain.
“I will attend to Master Robert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this Sarah had to content herself, and she went
back to the nursery. Robert was nowhere to be seen, and
made no reply to her summons. On this the unwary nurse-maid
flounced into the bed-room to look for him, when Robert,
who was hidden beneath a table, darted forth, and
promptly locked her in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re under arrest,” he shouted, through the key-hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me out!” shrieked Sarah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send a file of the guard to fetch you to the orderly-room,
by-and-by,” said Robert, “for ‘preferring frivolous
complaints.’ ” And he departed to the farm-yard to look at
the ducks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, when Robert went up to bed, the Captain
quietly locked him into his dressing-room, from which the
bed had been removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re for sentry duty, to-night,” said the Captain.
“The carpet-brush is in the corner. Good-evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As his father anticipated, Robert was soon tired of the
sentry game in these new circumstances, and long before the
night had half worn away he wished himself safely undressed
and in his own comfortable bed. At half-past twelve o’clock
he felt as if he could bear it no longer, and knocked at the
Captain’s door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who goes there?” said the Captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mayn’t I go to bed, please?” whined poor Robert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not,” said the Captain. “You’re on duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And on duty poor Robert had to remain, for the Captain
had a will as well as his son. So he rolled himself up in his
father’s railway rug, and slept on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next night he was very glad to go quietly to bed, and
remain there.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IN THE NURSERY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> Captain’s children sat at breakfast in a large, bright
nursery. It was the room where the old bachelor had died,
and now <span class='it'>her</span> children made it merry. This was just what he
would have wished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all sat round the table, for it was breakfast-time.
There were five of them, and five bowls of boiled bread-and-milk
smoked before them. Sarah (a foolish, gossiping girl,
who acted as nurse till better could be found) was waiting on
them, and by the table sat Darkie, the black retriever, his
long, curly back swaying slightly from the difficulty of holding
himself up, and his solemn hazel eyes fixed very intently
on each and all of the breakfast bowls. He was as silent
and sagacious as Sarah was talkative and empty-headed.
The expression of his face was that of King Charles I. as
painted by Vandyke. Though large, he was unassuming.
Pax, the pug, on the contrary, who came up to the first joint
of Darkie’s leg, stood defiantly on his dignity (and his short
stumps). He always placed himself in front of the bigger
dog, and made a point of hustling him in doorways and of
going first downstairs. He strutted like a beadle, and carried
his tail more tightly curled than a bishop’s crook. He
looked as one may imagine the frog in the fable would have
looked had he been able to swell himself rather nearer to the
size of the ox. This was partly due to his very prominent
eyes, and partly to an obesity favored by habits of lying inside
the fender and of eating meals proportioned more to his
consequence than to his hunger. They were both favorites
of two years’ standing, and had very nearly been given away,
when the good news came of an English home for the family,
dogs and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert’s tongue was seldom idle, even at meals. “Are
you a Yorkshirewoman, Sarah?” he asked, pausing, with
his spoon full in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Master Robert,” said Sarah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you understand Yorkshire, don’t you? I can’t, very
often; but mamma can, and can speak it, too. Papa says
mamma always talks Yorkshire to servants and poor people.
She used to talk Yorkshire to Themistocles, papa said, and
he said it was no good; for though Themistocles knew a lot
of langages, he didn’t know that. And mamma laughed,
and said she didn’t know she did.”—“Themistocles was our
man-servant in Corfu,” Robin added, in explanation. “He
stole lots of things, Themistocles did; but papa found him
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin now made a rapid attack on his bread-and-milk, after
which he broke out again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sarah, who is that tall old gentleman at church, in the
seat near the pulpit? He wears a cloak like what the
Blues wear, only all blue, and is tall enough for a Life-guardsman.
He stood up while we were kneeling, and said, <span class='it'>Almighty
and most merciful Father</span> louder than anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah knew who the old gentleman was, and knew also
that the children did not know, and that their parents did
not see fit to tell them as yet. But she had a passion for
telling and hearing news, and would rather gossip with a
child than not gossip at all. “Never you mind, Master
Robin,” she said, nodding sagaciously. “Little boys aren’t
to know everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, then, I know you don’t know,” replied Robert; “if
you did, you’d tell. Nicholas, give some of your bread to
Darkie and Pax. I’ve done mine. <span class='it'>For what we have received
the Lord make us truly thankful.</span> Say your grace and
put your chair away, and come along. I want to hold a
court-martial.” And seizing his own chair by the seat,
Robin carried it swiftly to its corner. As he passed Sarah
he observed tauntingly, “You pretend to know, but you
don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” said Sarah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t,” said Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your ma’s forbid you to contradict, Master Robin,” said
Sarah; “and if you do, I shall tell her. I know well enough
who the old gentleman is, and perhaps I might tell you, only
you’d go straight off and tell again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, I wouldn’t!” shouted Robin. “I can keep a
secret, indeed I can! Pinch my little finger, and try. Do,
do tell me, Sarah, there’s a dear Sarah, and then I shall
know you know.” And he danced round her, catching at
her skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To keep a secret was beyond Sarah’s powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do let my dress be, Master Robin,” she said, “you’re
ripping out all the gathers, and listen while I whisper. As
sure as you’re a living boy, that gentleman’s your own grandpapa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin lost his hold on Sarah’s dress; his arms fell by his
side, and he stood with his brows knit for some minutes, thinking.
Then he said, emphatically, “What lies you do tell,
Sarah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Robin!” cried Nicholas, who had drawn near, his
thick curls standing stark with curiosity, “mamma said
‘lies’ wasn’t a proper word, and you promised not to say it
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgot,” said Robin. “I didn’t mean to break my
promise. But she does tell—ahem!—<span class='it'>you know what</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wicked boy!” cried the enraged Sarah; “how
dare you to say such a thing, and everybody in the place
knows he’s your ma’s own pa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go and ask her,” said Robin, and he was at the door
in a moment; but Sarah, alarmed by the thought of getting
into a scrape herself, caught him by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you go, love; it’ll only make your ma angry.
There; it was all my nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it’s not true?” said Robin, indignantly. “What
did you tell me so for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all my jokes and nonsense,” said the unscrupulous
Sarah. “But your ma wouldn’t like to know I’ve said such
a thing. And Master Robert wouldn’t be so mean as to tell
tales, would he love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not mean,” said Robin, stoutly; “and I don’t tell
tales; but you do, and you tell <span class='it'>you know what</span>, besides. However,
I won’t go this time; but I’ll tell you what—if you
tell tales of me to papa any more, I’ll tell him what you said
about the old gentleman in the blue coat.” With which
parting threat Robin strode off to join his brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah’s tale had put the court-martial out of his head, and
he leaned against the tall fender, gazing at his little sister,
who was tenderly nursing a well-worn doll. Robin sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a long time that doll takes to wear out, Dora!”
said he. “When will it be done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not yet, not yet!” cried Dora, clasping the doll to
her, and turning away. “She’s quite good, yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How miserly you are,” said her brother; “and selfish,
too; for you know I can’t have a military funeral till you’ll
let me bury that old thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dora began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you go, crying!” said Robin, impatiently. “Look
here; I won’t take it till you get the new one on your birthday.
You can’t be so mean as not to let me have it then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dora’s tears still fell. “I love this one so much,”
she sobbed. “I love her better than the new one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want both; that’s it,” said Robin, angrily.
“Dora, you’re the meanest girl I ever knew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At which unjust and painful accusation Dora threw herself
and the doll upon their faces, and wept bitterly. The
eyes of the soft hearted Nicholas began to fill with tears,
and he squatted down before her looking most dismal. He
had a fellow-feeling for her attachment to an old toy, and yet
Robin’s will was law to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t we make a coffin, and pretend the body was inside?”
he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we couldn’t,” said Robin. “I wouldn’t play the
Dead March after an empty candle-box. It’s a great shame—and
I promised she should be chaplain in one of my night-gowns,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you’ll get just as fond of the new one,” said
Nicholas, turning to Dora.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dora only cried, “No, no! He shall have the new
one to bury, and I’ll keep my poor, dear, darling Betsy.”
And she clasped Betsy tighter than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the meanest thing you’ve said yet,” retorted Robin;
“for you know mamma wouldn’t let me bury the new one.”
And, with an air of great disgust, he quitted the nursery.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>“A MUMMING WE WILL GO.”</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Nicholas</span> had sore work to console his little sister, and
Betsy’s prospects were in a very unfavorable state, when a
diversion was caused in her favor by a new whim which put
the military funeral out of Robin’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he left the nursery he strolled out of doors, and,
peeping through the gate at the end of the drive, he saw a
party of boys going through what looked like a military exercise
with sticks and a good deal of stamping; but, instead
of mere words of command, they all spoke by turns as in a
play. In spite of their strong Yorkshire accent, Robin overheard
a good deal, and it sounded very fine. Not being at
all shy, he joined them, and asked so many questions that he
soon got to know all about it. They were practising a
Christmas mumming-play, called “The Peace-Egg.” Why
it was called thus they could not tell him, as there was nothing
whatever about eggs in it, and so far from being a play
of peace, it was made up of a series of battles between certain
valiant knights and princes, of whom St. George of
England was the chief and conqueror. The rehearsal being
over, Robin went with the boys to the sexton’s house (he was
father to the “King of Egypt”), where they showed him the
dresses they were to wear. These were made of gay-colored
materials, and covered with ribbons, except that of the
“Black Prince of Paradine,” which was black, as became
his title. The boys also showed him the book from which they
learned their parts, and which was to be bought for one
penny at the post-office shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then are you the mummers who come round at Christmas,
and act in people’s kitchens, and people give them money,
that mamma used to tell us about?” said Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. George of England looked at his companions as if for
counsel as to how far they might commit themselves, and
then replied, with Yorkshire caution, “Well, I suppose we
are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you go out in the snow from one house to another
at night; and oh, don’t you enjoy it?” cried Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We like it well enough,” St. George admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin bought a copy of “The Peace-Egg.” He was resolved
to have a nursery performance, and to act the part of
St. George himself. The others were willing for what he
wished, but there were difficulties. In the first place, there
are eight characters in the play, and there were only five
children. They decided among themselves to leave out “the
Fool,” and mamma said that another character was not to be
acted by any of them, or indeed mentioned; “the little one
who comes in at the end,” Robin explained. Mamma had
her reasons, and these were always good. She had not been
altogether pleased that Robin had bought the play. It was
a very old thing, she said, and very queer; not adapted for a
child’s play. If mamma thought the parts not quite fit for
the children to learn, they found them much too long; so in
the end she picked out some bits for each, which they learned
easily, and which, with a good deal of fighting, made quite
as good a story of it as if they had done the whole. What
may have been wanting otherwise was made up for by the
dresses, which were charming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin was St. George, Nicholas the Valiant Slasher,
Dora the Doctor, and the other two Hector and the King of
Egypt. “And now we’ve no Black Prince!” cried Robin
in dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let Darkie be the Black Prince,” said Nicholas.
“When you wave your stick he’ll jump for it, and then you
can pretend to fight with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a stick, it’s a sword,” said Robin. “However,
Darkie may be the Black Prince.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what’s Pax to be?” asked Dora; “for you know
he will come if Darkie does, and he’ll run in before everybody
else too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he must be the Fool,” said Robin, “and it will do
very well, for the Fool comes in before the rest, and Pax
can have his red coat on, and the collar with the little
bells.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHRISTMAS EVE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Robin</span> thought that Christmas would never come. To
the Captain and his wife it seemed to come too fast. They
had hoped it might bring reconciliation with the old man, but
it seemed they had hoped in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were times now when the Captain almost regretted
the old bachelor’s bequest. The familiar scenes of her old
home sharpened his wife’s grief. To see her father every
Sunday in church, with marks of age and infirmity upon
him, but with not a look of tenderness for his only child,
this tried her sorely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She felt it less abroad,” thought the Captain. “An
English home in which she frets herself to death is, after all,
no great boon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christmas eve came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure it’s quite Christmas enough now,” said Robin.
“We’ll have ‘The Peace-Egg’ to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So as the Captain and his wife sat sadly over their fire, the
door opened, and Pax ran in shaking his bells, and followed
by the nursery mummers. The performance was most successful.
It was by no means pathetic, and yet, as has been
said, the Captain’s wife shed tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter, mamma?” said St. George, abruptly
dropping his sword and running up to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tease mamma with questions,” said the Captain;
“she’s not very well, and rather sad. We must all be very
kind and good to poor dear mamma;” and the Captain
raised his wife’s hand to his lips as he spoke. Robin seized
the other hand and kissed it tenderly. He was very fond
of his mother. At this moment Pax took a little run, and
jumped on to mamma’s lap, where, sitting facing the company,
he opened his black mouth and yawned, with a ludicrous inappropriateness
worthy of any clown. It made everybody
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now we’ll go and act in the kitchen,” said Nicholas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supper at nine o’clock, remember,” shouted the Captain.
“And we are going to have real frumenty and yule
cakes, such as mamma used to tell us of when we were
abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurray!” shouted the mummers, and they ran off, Pax
leaping from his seat just in time to hustle the Black Prince
in the doorway. When the dining-room door was shut,
St. George raised his hand, and said “Hush!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mummers pricked their ears, but there was only a
distant harsh and scraping sound, as of stones rubbed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re cleaning the passages,” St. George went on,
“and Sarah told me they meant to finish the mistletoe, and
have everything cleaned up by supper-time. They don’t
want us, I know. Look here, we’ll go <span class='it'>real mumming</span> instead.
That <span class='it'>will</span> be fun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Valiant Slasher grinned with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But will mamma let us?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it will be all right if we’re back by supper-time,”
said St. George, hastily. “Only of course we must take
care not to catch cold. Come and help me to get some
wraps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old oak chest in which spare shawls, rugs, and coats
were kept was soon ransacked, and the mummers’ gay
dresses hidden by motley wrappers. But no sooner did
Darkie and Pax behold the coats, &amp;c., than they at once
began to leap and bark, as it was their custom to do when
they saw any one dressing to go out. Robin was sorely
afraid that this would betray them; but though the Captain
and his wife heard the barking they did not guess the
cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the front door being very gently opened and closed, the
nursery mummers stole away.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE NURSERY MUMMERS AND THE OLD MAN.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a very fine night. The snow was well-trodden on
the drive, so that it did not wet their feet, but on the trees
and shrubs it hung soft and white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s much jollier being out at night than in the daytime,”
said Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much,” responded Nicholas, with intense feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go a wassailing next week,” said Robin. “I
know all about it, and perhaps we shall get a good lot of
money, and then we’ll buy tin swords with scabbards for
next year. I don’t like these sticks. Oh, dear, I wish it
wasn’t so long between one Christmas and another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall we go first?” asked Nicholas, as they
turned into the high road. But before Robin could reply,
Dora clung to Nicholas, crying, “Oh, look at those
men!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys looked up the road, down which three men were
coming in a very unsteady fashion, and shouting as they
rolled from side to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re drunk,” said Nicholas; “and they’re shouting
at us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, run, run!” cried Dora; and down the road they
ran, the men shouting and following them. They had not
run far, when Hector caught his foot in the Captain’s great-coat,
which he was wearing, and came down head-long in
the road. They were close by a gate, and when Nicholas
had set Hector upon his legs, St. George hastily opened it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the first house,” he said. “We’ll act here;”
and all, even the Valiant Slasher, pressed in as quickly as
possible. Once safe within the grounds, they shouldered
their sticks, and resumed their composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to the front door,” said Nicholas. “Mummers
ought to go to the back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t know where it is,” said Robin, and he rang
the front door bell. There was a pause. Then lights
shone, steps were heard, and at last a sound of much unbarring,
unbolting, and unlocking. It might have been a
prison. Then the door was opened by an elderly, timid-looking
woman, who held a tallow candle above her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” she said, “at this time of night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re Christmas mummers,” said Robin, stoutly; “we
didn’t know the way to the back door, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t you know better than to come here?” said
the woman. “Be off with you, as fast as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re only the servant,” said Robin. “Go and ask
your master and mistress if they wouldn’t like to see us
act. We do it very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You impudent boy, be off with you!” repeated the
woman. “Master’d no more let you nor any other such
rubbish set foot in this house——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woman!” shouted a voice close behind her, which made
her start as if she had been shot, “who authorizes you to
say what your master will or will not do, before you’ve asked
him? The boy is right. You <span class='it'>are</span> the servant, and it is not
your business to choose for me whom I shall or shall not
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant no harm, sir, I’m sure,” said the housekeeper;
“but I thought you’d never——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good woman,” said her master, “if I had wanted
somebody to think for me, you’re the last person I should
have employed. I hire you to obey orders, not to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure, sir,” said the housekeeper, whose only form of
argument was reiteration, “I never thought you would have
seen them——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you were wrong,” shouted her master. “I will
see them. Bring them in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a tall, gaunt old man, and Robin stared at him
for some minutes, wondering where he could have seen somebody
very like him. At last he remembered. It was the
old gentleman of the blue cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children threw off their wraps, the housekeeper helping
them, and chattering ceaselessly, from sheer nervousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to be sure,” said she, “their dresses are pretty,
too. And they seem quite a better sort of children, they
talk quite genteel. I might ha’ knowed they weren’t like
common mummers, but I was so flustrated hearing the bell
go so late, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they ready?” said the old man, who had stood like
a ghost in the dim light of the flaring tallow candle, grimly
watching the proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. Shall I take them to the kitchen, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—— for you and the other idle hussies to gape and
grin at? No. Bring them to the library,” he snapped,
and then stalked off, leading the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The housekeeper accordingly led them to the library, and
then withdrew, nearly falling on her face as she left the
room by stumbling over Darkie, who slipped in last like a
black shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man was seated in a carved oak chair by the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never said the dogs were to come in,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we can’t do without them, please,” said Robin,
boldly. “You see there are eight people in ‘The Peace-Egg,’
and there are only five of us; and so Darkie has to be
the Black Prince, and Pax has to be the fool, and so we
have to have them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five and two make seven,” said the old man, with a
grim smile; “what do you do for the eighth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s the little one at the end,” said Robin, confidentially.
“Mamma said we weren’t to mention him, but
I think that’s because we’re children.”—“You’re grown up,
you know, so I’ll show you the book, and you can see for
yourself,” he went on, drawing ‘The Peace-Egg’ from his
pocket: “there, that’s the picture of him, on the last page;
black, with horns and a tail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man’s stern face relaxed into a broad smile as he
examined the grotesque woodcut; but when he turned to the
first page the smile vanished in a deep frown, and his eyes
shone like hot coals with anger. He had seen Robin’s
name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who sent you here?” he asked, in a hoarse voice.
“Speak, and speak the truth! Did your mother send you
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin thought the old man was angry with them for playing
truant. He said, slowly “N—no. She didn’t exactly
send us; but I don’t think she’ll mind our having come if we
get back in time for supper. Mamma never <span class='it'>forbid</span> our
going mumming, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose she ever thought of it,” Nicholas said,
candidly, wagging his curly head from side to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She knows we’re mummers,” said Robin, “for she
helped us. When we were abroad, you know, she used to
tell us about the mummers acting at Christmas, when she
was a little girl; and so we thought we’d be mummers, and
so we acted to papa and mamma, and so we thought we’d
act to the maids, but they were cleaning the passages, and so
we thought we’d really go mumming; and we’ve got several
other houses to go to before supper-time; we’d better begin,
I think,” said Robin; and without more ado he began to
march round and round, raising his sword and shouting,—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>And the performance went off quite as creditably as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> the children acted the old man’s anger wore off. He
watched them with an interest he could not express. When
Nicholas took some hard thwacks from St. George without
flinching, the old man clapped his hands; and after the encounter
between St. George and the Black Prince, he said
he would not have had the dogs excluded on any consideration.
It was just at the end, when they were all marching round
and round, holding on by each other’s swords “over the
shoulder,” and singing “A mumming we will go, &amp;c.,” that
Nicholas suddenly brought the circle to a standstill by stopping
dead short, and staring up at the wall before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>are</span> you stopping for?” said St. George, turning
indignantly round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look there!” cried Nicholas, pointing to a little painting
which hung above the old man’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robin looked, and said, abruptly, “It’s Dora.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is Dora?” asked the old man, in a strange sharp
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here she is,” said Robin and Nicholas in one breath, as
they dragged her forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s the Doctor,” said Robin; “and you can’t see her
face for her things. Dor, take off your cap and pull back
that hood. There! Oh, it <span class='it'>is</span> like her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a portrait of her mother as a child; but of this the
nursery mummers knew nothing. The old man looked as
the peaked cap and hood fell away from Dora’s face and
fair curls, and then he uttered a sharp cry, and buried his
head upon his hands. The boys stood stupefied, but Dora
ran up to him, and, putting her little hands on his arms,
said, in childish pitying tones, “Oh, I am so sorry! Have
you got a headache? May Robin put the shovel in the fire
for you? Mamma has hot shovels for her headaches.”
And, though the old man did not speak or move, she went
on coaxing him, and stroking his head, on which the hair
was white. At this moment Pax took one of his unexpected
runs, and jumped on to the old man’s knee, in his own particular
fashion, and then yawned at the company. The old
man was startled and lifted his face suddenly. It was wet
with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’re crying!” exclaimed the children with one
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very odd,” said Robin, fretfully. “I can’t think
what’s the matter to-night. Mamma was crying too when
we were acting, and papa said we weren’t to tease her with
questions, and he kissed her hand, and I kissed her hand too.
And papa said we must all be very good and kind to poor
dear mamma, and so I mean to be, she’s so good. And I
think we’d better go home, or perhaps she’ll be frightened,”
Robin added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s so good, is she?” asked the old man. He had
put Pax off his knee, and taken Dora on to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, isn’t she!” said Nicholas, swaying his curly head
from side to side as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s always good,” said Robin emphatically; “and so’s
papa. But I’m always doing something I oughtn’t to,” he
added, slowly. “But then, you know, I don’t pretend to
obey Sarah. I don’t care a fig for Sarah; and I won’t obey
any woman but mamma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s Sarah?” asked the grandfather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s our nurse,” said Robin, “and she tells—I mustn’t
say what she tells—but it’s not the truth. She told one
about <span class='it'>you</span> the other day,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About me?” said the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said you were our grandpapa. So then I knew she
was telling <span class='it'>you know what</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you know it wasn’t true?” the old man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course,” said Robin, “if you were our mamma’s
father, you’d know her, and be very fond of her, and come
and see her. And then you’d be our grandfather, too, and
you’d have us to see you, and perhaps give us Christmas-boxes.
I wish you were,” Robin added with a sigh. “It
would be very nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would <span class='it'>you</span> like it?” asked the old man of Dora.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Dora, who was half asleep and very comfortable, put
her little arms about his neck as she was wont to put them
round the Captain’s, and said, “Very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put her down at last, very tenderly, almost unwillingly,
and left the children alone. By-and-by he returned, dressed
in the blue cloak, and took Dora up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will see you home,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children had not been missed. The clock had only
just struck nine when there came a knock on the door of the
dining-room, where the Captain and his wife still sat by the
yule-log. She said “Come in,” wearily, thinking it was
frumenty and the Christmas cakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was her father, with her child in her arms!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PEACE AND GOODWILL.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Lucy Jane Bull</span> and her sisters were quite old enough
to understand a good deal of grown-up conversation when
they overheard it. Thus, when a friend of Mrs. Bull’s observed
during an afternoon call that she believed that
“officers’ wives were very dressy,” the young ladies were at
once resolved to keep a sharp look-out for the Captain’s
wife’s bonnet in church on Christmas Day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bulls had just taken their seats when the Captain’s
wife came in. They really would have hid their faces, and
looked at the bonnet afterwards, but for the startling sight
that met the gaze of the congregation. The old grandfather
walked into church abreast of the Captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve met in the porch,” whispered Mr. Bull under
the shelter of his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can’t quarrel publicly in a place of worship,” said
Mrs. Bull, turning pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s gone into his seat,” cried Lucy Jane in a shrill
whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the children after her,” added the other sister, incautiously
aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was now no doubt about the matter. The old man
in his blue cloak stood for a few moments, politely disputing
the question of precedence with his handsome son-in-law.
Then the Captain bowed and passed in, and the old man followed
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time that the service was ended everybody knew
of the happy peacemaking, and was glad. One old friend
after another came up with blessings and good wishes. This
was a proper Christmas, indeed, they said. There was a
general rejoicing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But only the grandfather and his children knew that it
was hatched from “The Peace-Egg.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span><h1>THE BROWNIES.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A little</span> girl sat sewing and crying on a garden seat.
She had fair floating hair, which the breeze blew into her
eyes; and between the cloud of hair, and the mist of tears,
she could not see her work very clearly. She neither tied up
her locks, nor dried her eyes, however; for when one is miserable,
one may as well be completely so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?” said the Doctor, who was a
friend of the Rector’s, and came into the garden whenever
he pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor was a tall stout man, with hair as black as
crows’ feathers on the top, and gray underneath, and a
bushy beard. When young, he had been slim and handsome,
with wonderful eyes, which were wonderful still; but that
was many years past. He had a great love for children, and
this one was a particular friend of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in a row,” murmured the young lady through her
veil; and the needle went in damp, and came out with a
jerk, which is apt to result in what ladies called “puckering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are like London in a yellow fog,” said the Doctor,
throwing himself on to the grass, “and it is very depressing
to my feelings. What is the row about, and how came you
to get into it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re all in it,” was the reply; and apparently the fog
was thickening, for the voice grew less and less distinct—“the
boys and everybody. It’s all about forgetting, and
not putting away, and leaving about, and borrowing, and
breaking, and that sort of thing. I’ve had father’s new
pocket-handkerchiefs to hem, and I’ve been out climbing
with the boys, and kept forgetting and forgetting, and mother
says I always forget; and I can’t help it. I forget to tidy his
newspapers for him, and I forget to feed Puss, and I forgot
these; besides, they’re a great bore, and mother gave them
to Nurse to do, and this one was lost, and we found it this
morning tossing about in the toy-cupboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as if it had been taking violent exercise,” said
the Doctor. “But what have the boys to do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, then there was a regular turn out of the toys,”
she explained, “and they’re all in a regular mess. You
know, we always go on till the last minute, and then things
get crammed in anyhow. Mary and I did tidy them once
or twice; but the boys never put anything away, you know,
so what’s the good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, indeed!” said the Doctor. “And so you have
complained of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! no!” answered she. “We don’t get them into
rows, unless they are very provoking; but some of the
things were theirs, so everybody was sent for, and I was sent
out to finish this, and they are all tidying. I don’t know
when it will be done, for I have all this side to hem; and
the soldier’s box is broken, and Noah is lost out of the
Noah’s Ark, and so is one of the elephants and a guinea-pig,
and so is the rocking-horse’s nose; and nobody knows what
has become of Rutlandshire and the Wash, but they’re so
small, I don’t wonder; only North America and Europe are
gone too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor started up in affected horror. “Europe gone,
did you say? Bless me! what will become of us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” said the young lady, kicking petulantly with
her dangling feet, and trying not to laugh. “You know I
mean the puzzles; and if they were yours, you wouldn’t
like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t half like it as it is,” said the Doctor. “I am
seriously alarmed. An earthquake is one thing: you have a
good shaking, and settle down again. But Europe gone—lost— Why,
here comes Deordie, I declare, looking much
more cheerful than we do; let us humbly hope that Europe
has been found. At present I feel like Aladdin when his
palace had been transported by the magician; I don’t know
where I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re here, Doctor; aren’t you?” asked the slow curly-wigged
brother, squatting himself on the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Is</span> Europe found?” said the Doctor tragically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” laughed Deordie. “I found it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be a great man,” said the Doctor. “And—it
is only common charity to ask—how about North America?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Found too,” said Deordie. “But the Wash is completely
lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my six shirts in it!” said the Doctor. “I sent
them last Saturday as ever was. What a world we live in!
Any more news? Poor Tiny here has been crying her eyes
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry, Tiny,” said the brother. “But don’t
bother about it. It’s all square now, and we’re going to
have a new shelf put up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you found everything?” asked Tiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, not the Wash, you know. And the elephant and
the guinea-pig are gone for good; so the other elephant and
the other guinea-pig must walk together as a pair now.
Noah was among the soldiers, and we have put the cavalry
into a night-light box. Europe and North America were
behind the book-case; and, would you believe it? the rocking-horse’s
nose has turned up in the nursery oven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t believe it,” said the Doctor. “The rocking-horse’s
nose couldn’t turn up, it was the purest Grecian,
modelled from the Elgin marbles. Perhaps it was the heat
that did it, though. However, you seem to have got through
your troubles very well, Master Deordie. I wish poor Tiny
were at the end of her task.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Deordie ruefully. “But I tell you what
I’ve been thinking, Doctor. Nurse is always knagging at
us, and we’re always in rows of one sort or another, for doing
this, and not doing that, and leaving our things about. But,
you know, it’s a horrid shame, for there are plenty of servants,
and I don’t see why we should be always bothering
to do little things, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! come to the point, please,” said the Doctor; “you
do go round the square so, in telling your stories, Deordie.
What have you been thinking of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Deordie, who was as good tempered as he
was slow, “the other day Nurse shut me up in the back
nursery for borrowing her scissors and losing them; but I’d
got ‘Grimm’ inside one of my knickerbockers, so when she
locked the door, I sat down to read. And I read the story
of the Shoemaker and the little Elves who came and did his
work for him before he got up; and I thought it would be so
jolly if we had some little Elves to do things instead of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Tommy Trout said,” observed the Doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s Tommy Trout?” asked Deordie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know, Deor?” said Tiny. “It’s the good
boy who pulled the cat out of the what’s-his-name.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>‘Who pulled her out?</p>
<p class='line0'>Little Tommy Trout.’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Is it the same Tommy Trout, Doctor? I never heard anything
else about him except his pulling the cat out; and I
can’t think how he did that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let down the bucket for her, of course,” said the Doctor.
“But listen to me. If you will get that handkerchief
done, and take it to your mother with a kiss, and not keep
me waiting, I’ll have you all to tea, and tell you the story
of Tommy Trout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This very night?” shouted Deordie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This very night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one of us?” inquired the young gentleman with
rapturous incredulity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one of you.—Now Tiny, how about that work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just done,” said Tiny.—“Oh! Deordie, climb up
behind, and hold back my hair, there’s a darling, while I
fasten off. Oh! Deor, you’re pulling my hair out. Don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to make a pig-tail,” said Deor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t,” said Tiny, with feminine contempt, “You
can’t plait. What’s the good of asking boys to do anything?
There! it’s done at last. Now go and ask mother if we may
go.—Will you let me come, doctor,” she inquired, “if I do
as you said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure I will,” he answered. “Let me look at you.
Your eyes are swollen with crying. How can you be such a
silly little goose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you never cry?” asked Tiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was your age? Well, perhaps so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve never cried since, surely,” said Tiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor absolutely blushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course not,” she answered. “You’ve nothing to
cry about. You’re grown up, and you live all alone in a
beautiful house, and you do as you like, and never get into
rows, or have anybody but yourself to think about; and no
nasty pocket-handkerchiefs to hem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very nice; eh, Deordie?” said the Doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully jolly,” said Deordie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing else to wish for, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should keep harriers, and not a poodle, if I were a
man,” said Deordie; “but I suppose you could, if you
wanted to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to cry about, at any rate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think not!” said Deordie.—“There’s mother,
though; let’s go and ask her about the tea;” and off they
ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor stretched his six feet of length upon the
sward, dropped his gray head on a little heap of newly-mown
grass, and looked up into the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully jolly—no nasty pocket-handkerchiefs to hem,”
said he laughing to himself. “Nothing else to wish for;
nothing to cry about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, he lay still, staring at the sky, till the smile
died away, and tears came into his eyes. Fortunately, no
one was there to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could this “awfully jolly” Doctor be thinking of to
make him cry? He was thinking of a grave-stone in the
church-yard close by, and of a story connected with this
grave-stone which was known to everybody in the place
who was old enough to remember it. This story has nothing
to do with the present story, so it ought not to be told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet it has to do with the Doctor, and is very short, so
it shall be put in, after all.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE STORY OF A GRAVE-STONE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>One</span> early spring morning about twenty years before, a
man, going to his work at sunrise through the church-yard,
stopped by a flat stone which he had lately helped to lay
down. The day before, a name had been cut on it, which
he stayed to read; and below the name some one had
scrawled a few words in pencil, which he read also—<span class='it'>Pitifully
behold the sorrows of our hearts</span>. On the stone lay a
pencil, and a few feet from it lay the Doctor, face downwards,
as he had lain all night, with the hoar frost on his
black hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! these grave-stones (they were ugly things in those
days; not the light, hopeful, pretty crosses we set up now)
how they seem remorselessly to imprison and keep our dear
dead friends away from us! And yet they do not lie with a
feather’s weight upon the souls that are gone, while God
only knows how heavily they press upon the souls that are
left behind. Did the spirit whose body was with the dead,
stand that morning by the body whose spirit was with the
dead and pity him? Let us only talk about what we know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this it was said that the Doctor had got a fever, and
was dying, but he got better of it; and then that he was out
of his mind, but he got better of that, and came out looking
much as usual, except that his hair never seemed quite so
black again, as if a little of that night’s hoar frost still
remained. And no further misfortune happened to him that
I ever heard of; and as time went on he grew a beard, and
got stout, and kept a German poodle, and gave tea parties to
other people’s children. As to the grave-stone story, whatever
it was to him at the end of twenty years; it was a great
convenience to his friends; for when he said anything they
didn’t agree with, or did anything they couldn’t understand,
or didn’t say or do what was expected of him, what could be
easier or more conclusive than to shake one’s head and say,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fact is, our Doctor has been a little odd, <span class='it'>ever
since</span>—!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE DOCTOR’S TEA PARTY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> is one great advantage attendant upon invitations to
tea with a doctor. No objections can be raised on the score
of health. It is obvious that it must be fine enough to go
out when the doctor asks you, and that his tea-cakes may be
eaten with perfect impunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those tea-cakes were always good; to-night they were
utterly delicious; there was a perfect <span class='it'>abandon</span> of currants,
and the amount of citron peel was enervating to behold.
Then the housekeeper waited in awful splendor, and yet the
Doctor’s authority over her seemed as absolute as if he were
an Eastern despot. Deordie must be excused for believing
in the charms of living alone. It certainly has its advantages.
The limited sphere of duty conduces to discipline
in the household, demand does not exceed supply in the
article of waiting, and there is not that general scrimmage
of conflicting interests which besets a large family in the
most favored circumstances. The housekeeper waits in black
silk, and looks as if she had no meaner occupation than to
sit in a rocking-chair, and dream of damson cheese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rustling, hospitable, and subservient, this one retired at
last, and—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said the Doctor, “for the verandah; and to look
at the moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The company adjourned with a rush, the rear being brought
up by the poodle, who seemed quite used to the proceedings;
and there under the verandah, framed with passion flowers and
geraniums, the Doctor had gathered mats, rugs, cushions,
and arm-chairs, for the party; while far up in the sky, a
yellow-faced harvest moon looked down in awful benignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” said the Doctor. “Take your seats. Ladies
first, and gentlemen afterwards. Mary and Tiny race for
the American rocking-chair. Well done! Of course it will
hold both. Now boys, shake down. No one is to sit on
the stone, or put their feet on the grass; and when you’re
ready, I’ll begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re ready,” said the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys shook down in a few minutes more, and the
Doctor began the story of</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>“THE BROWNIES.”</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Bairns</span> are a burden,” said the Tailor to himself as he
sat at work. He lived in a village on some of the glorious
moors of the north of England; and by bairns he meant
children, as every Northman knows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bairns are a burden,” and he sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bairns are a blessing,” said the old lady in the window.
“It is the family motto. The Trouts have had large families
and good luck for generations; that is, till your grandfather’s
time. He had one only son. I married him. He
was a good husband, but he had been a spoilt child. He had
always been used to be waited upon, and he couldn’t fash to
look after the farm when it was his own. We had six children.
They are all dead but you, who were the youngest.
You were bound to a tailor. When the farm came into your
hands, your wife died, and you have never looked up since.
The land is sold now, but not the house. No! no! you’re
right enough there; but you’ve had your troubles, son Thomas,
and the lads <span class='it'>are</span> idle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Tailor’s mother who spoke. She was a very
old woman, and helpless. She was not quite so bright in her
intellect as she had been, and got muddled over things that
had lately happened; but she had a clear memory for what
was long past, and was very pertinacious in her opinions.
She knew the private history of almost every family in the
place, and who of the Trouts were buried under which old
stones in the church-yard; and had more tales of ghosts,
doubles, warnings, fairies, witches, hobgoblins, and such like,
than even her grandchildren had ever come to the end of.
Her hands trembled with age, and she regretted this for
nothing more than for the danger it brought her into of spilling
the salt. She was past housework, but all day she sat knitting
hearth-rugs out of the bits and scraps of cloth that were
shred in the tailoring. How far she believed in the wonder-tales
she told, and the odd little charms she practised, no
one exactly knew; but the older she grew, the stranger were
the things she remembered, and the more testy she was if any
one doubted their truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bairns are a blessing!” said she. “It is the family
motto.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Are they?</span>” said the Tailor, emphatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a high respect for his mother, and did not like to
contradict her, but he held his own opinion, based upon personal
experience; and not being a metaphysician, did not
understand that it is safer to found opinions on principles
than on experience, since experience may alter, but principles
cannot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at Tommy,” he broke out suddenly. “That boy
does nothing but whittle sticks from morning till night. I
have almost to lug him out of bed o’ mornings. If I send
him an errand, he loiters; I’d better have gone myself. If
I set him to do anything, I have to tell him everything; I
could sooner do it myself. And if he does work, it’s done so
unwillingly, with such a poor grace; better, far better, to do
it myself. What housework do the boys ever do but looking
after the baby? And this afternoon she was asleep in the
cradle, and off they went, and when she awoke, <span class='it'>I</span> must leave
my work to take her. <span class='it'>I</span> gave her her supper, and put her to
bed. And what with what they want and I have to get,
and what they take out to play with and lose, and what they
bring in to play with and leave about, bairns give some
trouble, Mother, and I’ve not an easy life of it. The pay is
poor enough when one can get the work, and the work is
hard enough when one has a clear day to do it in; but housekeeping
and bairn-minding don’t leave a man much time for
his trade. No! no! Ma’am, the luck of the Trouts is gone
and ‘Bairns are a burden,’ is the motto now. Though they
are one’s own,” he muttered to himself, “and not bad ones
and I did hope once would have been a blessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Johnnie,” murmured the old lady, dreamily.
“He has a face like an apple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is about as useful,” said the Tailor. “He might
have been different, but his brother leads him by the nose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brother led him in as the Tailor spoke, not literally
by his snub, though, but by the hand. They were a handsome
pair, this lazy couple. Johnnie especially had the
largest and roundest of foreheads, the reddest of cheeks, the
brightest of eyes, the quaintest and most twitchy of chins,
and looked altogether like a gutta percha cherub in a chronic
state of longitudinal squeeze. They were locked together
by two grubby paws, and had each an armful of moss, which
they deposited on the floor as they came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve swept this floor once to-day,” said the father, “and
I’m not going to do it again. Put that rubbish outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Move it Johnnie!” said his brother, seating himself on a
stool, and taking out his knife and a piece of wood, at which
he cut and sliced; while the apple cheeked Johnnie stumbled
and stamped over the moss, and scraped it out on to the
door-step, leaving long trails of earth behind him, and then
sat down also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And those chips the same,” added the Tailor; “I will
<span class='it'>not</span> clear up the litter you lads make.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pick ’em up, Johnnie,” said Thomas Trout, junior, with
an exasperated sigh; and the apple tumbled up, rolled after
the flying chips, and tumbled down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there any supper, Father?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, there is not, Sir, unless you know how to get it,”
said the Tailor; and taking his pipe, he went out of the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there really nothing to eat Granny?” asked the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my bairn, only some bread for breakfast to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes Father so cross, Granny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s wearied, and you don’t help him, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What could I do, Grandmother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many little things, if you tried,” said the old lady.
“He spent half-an-hour to-day while you were on the moor,
getting turf for the fire, and you could have got it just as
well, and he been at his work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never told me,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might help me a bit just now, if you would, my
laddie,” said the old lady coaxingly; “these bits of cloth
want tearing into lengths, and if you get ’em ready, I can
go on knitting. There’ll be some food when this mat is
done and sold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll try,” said Tommy, lounging up with desperate resignation.
“Hold my knife, Johnnie. Father’s been cross,
and everything has been miserable, ever since the farm was
sold. I wish I were a big man, and could make a fortune.—Will
that do, Granny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady put down her knitting and looked. “My
dear, that’s too short. Bless me! I gave the lad a piece to
measure by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it was the same length. Oh, dear! I am
so tired;” and he propped himself against the old lady’s
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear! don’t lean so! you’ll tipple me over!” she
shrieked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, Grandmother. Will <span class='it'>that</span> do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s that much too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tear that bit off. Now it’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear, that wastes it. Now that bit is of no
use. There goes my knitting, you awkward lad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Johnnie, pick it up!—Oh! Grandmother, I <span class='it'>am</span> so
hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s eyes filled with tears, and the old lady was
melted in an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do for you, my poor bairns?” said she.
“There, never mind the scraps, Tommy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us a tale, Granny. If you told us a new one, I
shouldn’t keep thinking of that bread in the cupboard.—Come
Johnny, and sit against me. Now then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if there’s one of my old-world cracks I haven’t
told you,” said the old lady, “unless it’s a queer ghost story
was told me years ago of that house in the hollow with the
blocked-up windows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! not ghosts!” Tommy broke in; “we’ve had so
many. I know it was a rattling, or a scratching, or a knocking,
or a figure in white; and if it turns out a tombstone or
a white petticoat, I hate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was nothing of the sort as a tombstone,” said the old
lady with dignity. “It’s a good half-mile from the church-yard.
And as to white petticoats, there wasn’t a female in
the house; he wouldn’t have one; and his victuals came in
by the pantry window. But never mind! Though it’s as
true as a sermon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Johnnie lifted his head from his brother’s knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let Granny tell what she likes, Tommy. It’s a new
ghost, and I should like to know who he was, and why his
victuals came in by the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like a story about victuals,” sulked Tommy.
“It makes me think of the bread. O Granny dear! do tell
us a fairy story. You never will tell us about the Fairies,
and I know you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! hush!” said the old lady. “There’s Miss Surbiton’s
Love Letter, and her Dreadful End.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know Miss Surbiton, Granny. I think she was a
goose. Why won’t you tell us about the Fairies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! hush! my dears. There’s the Clerk and the
Corpse-candles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the Corpse-candles, Granny. Besides, they
make Johnnie dream and he wakes me to keep him company.
<span class='it'>Why</span> won’t you tell us about the Fairies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, they don’t like it,” said the old lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Granny dear, why don’t they? Do tell! I shouldn’t
think of the bread a bit, if you told us about the Fairies. I
know nothing about them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lived in this house long enough,” said the old lady.
“But it’s not lucky to name him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Granny, we are so hungry and miserable, what can
it matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s true enough,” she sighed. “Trouts’ luck
is gone; it went with the Brownie, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that <span class='it'>he</span>, Granny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my dear, he lived with the Trouts for several generations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was he like, Granny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like a little man, they say, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He came in before the family were up, and swept up the
hearth, and lighted the fire, and set out the breakfast, and
tidied the room, and did all sorts of house-work. But he
never would be seen, and was off before they could catch
him. But they could hear him laughing and playing about
the house sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a darling! Did they give him any wages,
Granny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! my dear. He did it for love. They set a pancheon
of clear water for him over night, and now and then a
bowl of bread and milk, or cream. He liked that, for he
was very dainty. Sometimes he left a bit of money in the
water. Sometimes he weeded the garden or threshed the
corn. He saved endless trouble, both to men and maids.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Granny! why did he go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The maids caught sight of him one night, my dear, and
his coat was so ragged, that they got a new suit, and a linen
shirt for him, and laid them by the bread and milk bowl.
But when Brownie saw the things, he put them on, and
dancing round the kitchen, sang,</p>

<p class='noindent'>and so danced through the door and never came back
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Grandmother! But why not? Didn’t he like the
new clothes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Old Owl knows, my dear; I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s the Old Owl, Granny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t exactly know, my dear. It’s what my mother
used to say when we asked anything that puzzled her. It
was said that the Old Owl was Nancy Besom, (a witch, my
dear!) who took the shape of a bird, but couldn’t change
her voice, and that that’s why the owl sits silent all day for
fear she should betray herself by speaking, and has no singing
voice like other birds. Many people used to go and consult
the Old Owl at moon-rise, in my young days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever go, Granny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once, very nearly, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! tell us, Granny dear.—There are no Corpse-candles,
Johnnie; it’s only moonlight,” he added consolingly, as
Johnnie crept closer to his knee and pricked his little red
ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was when your grandfather was courting me, my
dears,” said the old lady, “and I couldn’t quite make up my
mind. So I went to my mother, and said, ‘He’s this on the
one side, but then he’s that on the other, and so on. Shall
I say yes or no?’ And my mother said, ‘The Old Owl
knows,’ for she was fairly puzzled. So says I, ‘I’ll go and
ask her to-night, as sure as the moon rises.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So at moon-rise I went, and there in the white light by
the gate stood your grandfather. ‘What are you doing here
at this time o’ night?’ says I. ‘Watching your window,’ says
he. ‘What are <span class='it'>you</span> doing here at this time o’ night?’
‘The Old Owl knows,’ said I, and burst out crying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?” said Johnnie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t rightly tell you, my dear,” said the old lady,
“but it gave me such a turn to see him. And without more
ado your grandfather kissed me. ‘How dare you?’ said I.
‘What do you mean?’ ‘The Old Owl knows,’ said he. So
we never went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How stupid!” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us more about Brownie, please,” said Johnnie.
“Did he ever live with anybody else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are plenty of Brownies,” said the old lady, “or
used to be in my mother’s young days. Some houses had
several.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I wish ours would come back!” cried both the
boys in chorus. “He’d —</p>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“tidy the room,” said Johnnie;</p>
<p class='line'>“fetch the turf,” said Tommy;</p>
<p class='line'>“pick up the chips,” said Johnnie;</p>
<p class='line'>“sort your scraps,” said Tommy;</p>
<p class='line'>“and do everything. Oh! I wish he hadn’t gone away.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” said the Tailor coming in at this moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the Brownie, Father,” said Tommy. “We are so
sorry he went, and do so wish we had one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nonsense have you been telling them, Mother?”
asked the Tailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heighty teighty,” said the old lady, bristling. “Nonsense,
indeed! As good men as you, Son Thomas, would as
soon have jumped off the crags, as spoken lightly of <span class='it'>them</span>, in
my mother’s young days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said the Tailor, “I beg their pardon. They
never did aught for me, whatever they did for my forbears;
but they’re as welcome to the old place as ever, if they
choose to come. There’s plenty to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you mind our setting a pan of water, Father?”
asked Tommy very gently. “There’s no bread and milk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may set what you like, my lad,” said the Tailor;
“and I wish there were bread and milk for your sakes,
Bairns. You should have it, had I got it. But go to bed
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lugged out a pancheon, and filled it with more dexterity
than usual, and then went off to bed, leaving the knife
in one corner, the wood in another, and a few splashes of
water in their track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was more room than comfort in the ruined old
farm-house, and the two boys slept on a bed of cut heather,
in what had been the old malt loft. Johnnie was soon in
the land of dreams, growing rosier and rosier as he slept, a
tumbled apple among the gray heather. But not so lazy
Tommy. The idea of a domesticated Brownie had taken
full possession of his mind; and whither Brownie had gone,
where he might be found, and what would induce him to return,
were mysteries he longed to solve. “There’s an owl
living in the old shed by the mere,” he thought. “It may
be the Old Owl herself, and she knows, Granny says. When
father’s gone to bed, and the moon rises I’ll go.” Meanwhile
he lay down.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon rose like gold, and went up into the heavens
like silver, flooding the moors with a pale ghostly light, taking
the color out of the heather, and painting black shadows
under the stone walls. Tommy opened his eyes, and ran to
the window. “The moon has risen,” said he, and crept
softly down the ladder, through the kitchen, where was the
pan of water, but no Brownie, and so out on the moor. The
air was fresh, not to say chilly; but it was a glorious night,
though everything but the wind and Tommy seemed asleep.
The stones, the walls, the gleaming lanes, were so intensely
still; the church tower in the valley seemed awake and
watching, but silent; the houses in the village round it all
had their eyes shut, that is, their window blinds down; and
it seemed to Tommy as if the very moors had drawn white
sheets over them, and lay sleeping also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hoot! hoot!” said a voice from the fir plantation behind
him. Somebody else was awake, then. “It’s the
Old Owl,” said Tommy; and there she came, swinging
heavily across the moor with a flapping stately flight, and
sailed into the shed by the mere. The old lady moved faster
than she seemed to do, and though Tommy ran hard she was
in the shed some time before him. When he got in, no bird
was to be seen, but he heard a crunching sound from above,
and looking up, there sat the Old Owl, pecking and tearing
and munching at some shapeless black object, and blinking
at him—Tommy—with yellow eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear!” said Tommy, for he didn’t much like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Old Owl dropped the black mass on to the floor; and
Tommy did not care somehow to examine it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up! come up!” said she, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could speak, then! Beyond all doubt it was <span class='it'>the</span> Old
Owl and none other. Tommy shuddered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up here! come up here!” said the Old Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Old Owl sat on a beam that ran across the shed.
Tommy had often climbed up for fun; and he climbed up
now, and sat face to face with her, and thought her eyes
looked as if they were made of flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kiss my fluffy face,” said the Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were going round like flaming catherine wheels,
but there are certain requests which one has not the option
of refusing. Tommy crept nearer, and put his lips to the
round face out of which the eyes shone. Oh! it was so
downy and warm, so soft, so indescribably soft. Tommy’s
lips sank into it, and couldn’t get to the bottom. It was
unfathomable feathers and fluffyness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what do you want?” said the Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please,” said Tommy, who felt rather re-assured, “can
you tell me where to find the Brownies, and how to get one
to come and live with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oohoo!” said the Owl, “that’s it, is it? I know of
three Brownies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah!” said Tommy. “Where do they live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In your house,” said the Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy was aghast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In our house!” he exclaimed. “Whereabouts? Let
me rummage them out. Why do they do nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of them is too young,” said the Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why don’t the others work?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are idle, they are idle,” said the Old Owl, and she
gave herself such a shake as she said it, that the fluff went
flying through the shed, and Tommy nearly tumbled off the
beam in his fright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we don’t want them,” said he. “What is the use
of having Brownies if they do nothing to help us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they don’t know how, as no one has told them,”
said the Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would tell me where to find them,” said
Tommy; “I could tell them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you?” said the Owl. “Oohoo! Oohoo!” and
Tommy couldn’t tell whether she were hooting or laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I could,” he said. “They might be up and
sweep the house, and light the fire, and spread the table,
and that sort of thing, before father came down. Besides,
they could <span class='it'>see</span> what was wanted. The Brownies did all
that in Granny’s mother’s young days. And then they
could tidy the room, and fetch the turf, and pick up
my chips, and sort Granny’s scraps. Oh! there’s lots to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So there is,” said the Owl. “Oohoo! Well, I can
tell you where to find one of the Brownies; and if you find
him, he will tell you where his brother is. But all this depends
upon whether you feel equal to undertaking it, and
whether you will follow my directions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am quite ready to go,” said Tommy, “and I will do
as you shall tell me. I feel sure I could persuade them.
If they only knew how every one would love them if they
made themselves useful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oohoo! ohoo!” said the Owl. “Now pay attention.
You must go to the north side of the mere when the moon
is shining—(‘I know Brownies like water,’ muttered
Tommy)—and turn yourself around three times, saying
this charm:</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>When you have got so far, look into the water, and at the
same moment you will see the Brownie, and think of a
word that will fill up the couplet, and rhyme with the first
line. If either you do not see the Brownie, or fail to think
of the word, it will be of no use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the Brownie a mermaid,” said Tommy, wriggling
himself along the beam, “that he lives under water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends on whether he has a fish’s tail,” said the
Owl, “and this you can discover for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the moon is shining, so I shall go,” said Tommy.
“Good-bye, and thank you, Ma’am;” and he jumped down
and went, saying to himself as he ran, “I believe he is a
merman all the same, or else how could he live in the mere?
I know more about Brownies than Granny does, and I shall
tell her so;” for Tommy was somewhat opinionated, like
other young people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon shone very brightly on the centre of the mere.
Tommy knew the place well for there was a fine echo there.
Round the edge grew rushes and water plants, which cast
a border of shadow. Tommy went to the north side, and
turning himself three times, as the old Owl had told him,
he repeated the charm—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now for it. He looked in, and saw—the reflection of his
own face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there’s no one but myself!” said Tommy. “And
what can the word be? I must have done it wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wrong!” said the Echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy was almost surprised to find the echo awake at
this time of night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold your tongue!” said he. “Matters are provoking
enough of themselves. Belf! Celf! Delf! Felf! Gelf! Helf!
Jelf! What rubbish! There can’t be a word to fit it. And
then to look for Brownie, and see nothing but myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myself!” said the Echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you be quiet?” said Tommy. “If you would tell
one the word there would be some sense in your interference;
but to roar ‘Myself!’ at one, which neither rhymes
nor runs—it does rhyme though, as it happens,” he added;
“and how very odd! it runs too—</p>

<p class='noindent'>which I certainly did. What can it mean? The Old Owl
knows, as Granny would say; so I shall go back and ask
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask her!” said the Echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I say I should?” said Tommy. “How exasperating
you are! It is very strange. <span class='it'>Myself</span> certainly
does rhyme, and I wonder I did not think of it long ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go,” said the Echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you mind your own business, and go to sleep?”
said Tommy. “I am going; I said I should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And back he went. There sat the Old Owl as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oohoo!” said she, as Tommy climbed up. “What did
you see in the mere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw nothing but myself,” said Tommy indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did you expect to see?” asked the Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expected to see a Brownie,” said Tommy; “you told
me so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what are Brownies like, pray?” inquired the Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The one Granny knew was a useful little fellow, something
like a little man,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said the Owl, “but you know at present this one
is an idle little fellow, something like a little man. Oohoo!
oohoo! Are you quite sure you didn’t see him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite,” answered Tommy sharply. “I saw no one but
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hoot! toot! How touchy we are! And who are you,
pray?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not a Brownie,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too sure,” said the Owl. “Did you find out
the word?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Tommy. “I could find no word with any
meaning that would rhyme but ‘myself.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that runs and rhymes,” said the Owl. “What do
you want? Where’s your brother now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In bed in the malt-loft,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then now all your questions are answered,” said the
Owl, “and you know what wants doing, so go and do it.
Good-night, or rather good-morning, for it is long past midnight;”
and the old lady began to shake her feathers for a
start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t go yet, please,” said Tommy humbly. “I don’t
understand it. You know I’m not a Brownie, am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you are,” said the Owl, “and a very idle one too.
All children are Brownies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I couldn’t do work like a Brownie,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” inquired the Owl. “Couldn’t you sweep
the floor, light the fire, spread the table, tidy the room, fetch
the turf, pick up your own chips, and sort your grandmother’s
scraps? You know ‘there’s lots to do.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t think I should like it,” said Tommy. “I’d
much rather have a Brownie to do it for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what would you do meanwhile?” asked the Owl.
“Be idle, I suppose; and what do you suppose is the use of
a man’s having children if they do nothing to help him?
Ah! if they only knew how every one would love them if
they made themselves useful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is it really and truly so?” asked Tommy, in a dismal
voice. “Are there no Brownies but children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, there are not,” said the owl. “And pray do you
think that the Brownies, whoever they may be, come into a
house to save trouble for the idle healthy little boys who live
in it? Listen to me, Tommy,” said the old lady, her eyes
shooting rays of fire in the dark corner where she sat.
“Listen to me, you are a clever boy, and can understand
when one speaks; so I will tell you the whole history of the
Brownies, as it has been handed down in our family from my
grandmother’s great-grandmother, who lived in the Druid’s
Oak, and was intimate with the fairies. And when I have
done you shall tell me what you think they are, if they are
not children. It’s the opinion I have come to at any rate,
and I don’t think that wisdom died with our great-grandmothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to hear if you please,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Old Owl shook out a tuft or two of fluff, and set her
eyes a-going, and began:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Brownies, or as they are sometimes called, the
Small Folk, the Little People, or the Good People, are a
race of tiny beings who domesticate themselves in a house of
which some grown-up human being pays the rent and taxes.
They are like small editions of men and women, they are too
small and fragile for heavy work; they have not the strength
of a man, but are a thousand times more fresh and nimble.
They can run and jump, and roll and tumble, with marvellous
agility and endurance, and of many of the aches and
pains which men and women groan under, they do not even
know the names. They have no trade or profession, and as
they live entirely upon other people, they know nothing of
domestic cares; in fact, they know very little upon any subject,
though they are often intelligent and highly inquisitive.
They love dainties, play, and mischief. They are apt to be
greatly beloved, and are themselves capriciously affectionate.
They are little people, and can only do little things. When
they are idle and mischievous, they are called Boggarts, and
are a curse to the house they live in. When they are useful
and considerate, they are Brownies, and are a much-coveted
blessing. Sometimes the Blessed Brownies will take up their
abode with some worthy couple, cheer them with their romp
and merry laughter, tidy the house, find things that have
been lost, and take little troubles out of hands full of great
anxieties. Then in time these Little People are Brownies
no longer. They grow up into men and women. They do
not care so much for dainties, play, or mischief. They cease
to jump and tumble, and roll about the house. They know
more, and laugh less. Then, when their heads begin to ache
with anxiety, and they have to labor for their own living, and
the great cares of life come on, other Brownies come and live
with them, and take up their little cares, and supply their
little comforts, and make the house merry once more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How nice!” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very nice,” said the Old Owl. “But what”—and she
shook herself more fiercely than ever, and glared so that
Tommy expected nothing less than her eyes would set fire to
her feathers and she would be burnt alive. “But what must
I say of the Boggarts? Those idle urchins who eat the
bread and milk, and don’t do the work, who lie in bed without
an ache or pain to excuse them, who untidy instead of
tidying, cause work instead of doing it, and leave little cares
to heap on big cares, till the old people who support them are
worn out altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” said Tommy. “I can’t bear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope when Boggarts grow into men,” said the Old Owl,
“that their children will be Boggarts too, and then they’ll
know what it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” roared Tommy. “I won’t be a Boggart. I’ll
be a Brownie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” nodded the Old Owl. “I said you were
a boy who could understand when one spoke. And remember
that the Brownies never are seen at their work. They get
up before the household, and get away before any one can
see them. I can’t tell you why. I don’t think my grandmother’s
great-grandmother knew. Perhaps because all
good deeds are better done in secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please,” said Tommy, “I should like to go home now,
and tell Johnnie. It’s getting cold, and I am so tired!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true,” said the Old Owl, “and then you will have
to be up early to-morrow. I think I had better take you
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the way, thank you,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say <span class='it'>shew</span> you the way, I said <span class='it'>take</span> you—carry
you,” said the Owl. “Lean against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather not thank you,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lean against me,” screamed the Owl. “Oohoo! how
obstinate boys are to be sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy crept up, very unwillingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lean your full weight, and shut your eyes,” said the
Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy laid his head against the Old Owl’s feathers, had
a vague idea that she smelt of heather, and thought it must be
from living on the moor, shut his eyes, and leant his full
weight, expecting that he and the Owl would certainly fall
off the beam together. Down—feathers—fluff—he sank and
sank, could feel nothing solid, jumped up with a start to save
himself, opened his eyes, and found that he was sitting
among the heather in the malt-loft, with Johnny sleeping by
his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How quickly we came!” said he; “that is certainly a
very clever Old Owl. I couldn’t have counted ten whilst
my eyes were shut. How very odd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what was odder still was, that it was no longer moonlight
but early dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, Johnnie,” said his brother, “I’ve got a story
to tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And while Johnnie sat up, and rubbed his eyes open, he
related his adventures on the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is all that true?” said Johnnie; “I mean, did it really
happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it did,” said his brother; “don’t you believe
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” said Johnny. “But I thought it was perhaps
only a true story, like Granny’s true stories. I believe all
these, you know. But if you were there, you know, it is
different—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was there,” said Tommy, “and it’s all just as I tell
you: and I tell you what, if we mean to do anything we
must get up: though, oh dear! I should like to stay in bed.
I say,” he added, after a pause, “suppose we do. It can’t
matter being Boggarts for one night more. I mean to be a
Brownie before I grow up, though. I couldn’t stand boggarty
children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t be a Boggart at all,” said Johnnie, “it’s horrid.
But I don’t see how we can be Brownies, for I’m afraid we
can’t do the things. I wish I were bigger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do it well enough,” said Tommy, following his
brother’s example and getting up. “Don’t you suppose I
can light a fire? Think of all the bonfires we have made!
And I don’t think I should mind having a regular good tidy-up
either. It’s that stupid putting-away-things-when-you’ve-done-with-them
that I hate so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Brownies crept softly down the ladder and into the
kitchen. There was the blank hearth, the dirty floor, and
all the odds and ends lying about, looking cheerless enough
in the dim light, Tommy felt quite important as he looked
round. There is no such cure for untidiness as clearing
up after other people; one sees so clearly where the fault
lies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at that door-step, Johnnie,” said the Brownie-elect,
“what a mess you made of it! If you had lifted the
moss carefully, instead of stamping and struggling with it, it
would have saved us ten minutes’ work this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This wisdom could not be gainsaid, and Johnnie only
looked meek and rueful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to light the fire,” pursued his brother;—“the
next turfs, you know <span class='it'>we</span> must get—you can tidy a bit.
Look at the knife I gave you to hold last night, and that
wood—that’s my fault though, and so are those scraps by
Granny’s chair. What are you grubbing at that rat-hole
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Johnnie raised his head somewhat flushed and tumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think I have found?” said he triumphantly.
“Father’s measure that has been lost for a
week!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah!” said Tommy, “put it by his things. That’s
just a sort of thing for a Brownie to have done. What will
he say? And I say, Johnnie, when you’ve tidied, just go and
grub up a potato or two in the garden, and I’ll put them to
roast for breakfast. I’m lighting such a bonfire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire was very successful. Johnnie went after the
potatoes, and Tommy cleaned the door-step, swept the room,
dusted the chairs and the old chest, and set out the table.
There was no doubt he could be handy when he chose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you what I have thought of, if we have time,”
said Johnnie, as he washed the potatoes in the water that
had been set for Brownie. “We might run down to the
South Pasture for some mushrooms. Father said the reason
we found so few was that people go by sunrise for them to
take to market. The sun’s only just rising, we should be
sure to find some, and they would do for breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s plenty of time,” said Tommy; so they went.
The dew lay heavy and thick upon the grass by the road
side, and over the miles of network that the spiders had
woven from blossom to blossom of the heather. The dew is
the Sun’s breakfast; but he was barely up yet, and had not
eaten it, and the world felt anything but warm. Nevertheless,
it was so sweet and fresh as it is at no later hour of the
day, and every sound was like the returning voice of a long
absent friend. Down to the pastures, where was more network
and more dew, but when one has nothing to speak of
in the way of boots, the state of the ground is of the less
consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tailor had been right, there was no lack of mushrooms
at this time of the morning. All over the pasture they stood,
of all sizes, some like buttons, some like tables; and in the
distance one or two ragged women, stopping over them with
baskets, looked like huge fungi also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is where the fairies feast,” said Tommy. “They
had a large party last night. When they go, they take away
the dishes and cups, for they are made of gold; but they
leave their tables, and we eat them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder whether giants would like to eat our tables,”
said Johnnie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was beyond Tommy’s capabilities of surmise; so they
filled a handkerchief, and hurried back again for fear the
Tailor should have come down-stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were depositing the last mushroom in a dish on the
table, when his footsteps were heard descending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There he is!” exclaimed Tommy. “Remember, we
mustn’t be caught. Run back to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Johnnie caught up the handkerchief, and smothering their
laughter, the two scrambled back up the ladder, and dashed
straight into the heather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the poor Tailor came wearily down-stairs.
Day after day, since his wife’s death, he had come down
every morning to the same desolate sight—yesterday’s refuse
and an empty hearth. This morning task of tidying was always
a sad and ungrateful one to the widowed father. His
awkward struggles with the house-work in which <span class='it'>she</span> had
been so notable, chafed him. The dirty kitchen was dreary,
the labor lonely, and it was an hour’s time lost to his trade.
But life does not stand still while one is wishing, and so the
Tailor did that for which there was neither remedy nor substitute;
and came down this morning as other mornings to
the pail and broom. When he came in he looked round,
and started, and rubbed his eyes; looked round again, and
rubbed them harder; then went up to the fire and held out
his hand, (warm certainly)—then up to the table and smelt
the mushrooms, (esculent fungi beyond a doubt) handled the
loaf, stared at the open door and window, the swept floor,
and the sunshine pouring in, and finally sat down in stunned
admiration. Then he jumped up and ran to the foot of the
stairs, shouting,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother! Mother! Trout’s luck has come again.”
“And yet, no!” he thought, “the old lady’s asleep, it’s a
shame to wake her, I’ll tell those idle rascally lads, they’ll
be more pleased than they deserve. It was Tommy after
all that set the water and caught him.” “Boys! boys!” he
shouted at the foot of the ladder, “the Brownie has come!—and
if he hasn’t found my measure!” he added on returning
to the kitchen, “this is as good as a day’s work to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was great excitement in the small household that
day. The boys kept their own counsel. The old Grandmother
was triumphant, and tried not to seem surprised.
The Tailor made no such vain effort, and remained till bed-time
in a state of fresh and unconcealed amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve often heard of the Good People,” he broke out
towards the end of the evening. “And I’ve heard folk say
they’ve known those that have seen them capering round
the gray rocks on the moor at midnight: but this is wonderful!
To come and do the work for a pan of cold water!
Who could have believed it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might have believed it if you’d believed me, Son
Thomas,” said the old lady tossily. “I told you so. But
young people always know better than their elders!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t see him,” said the Tailor, beginning his story
afresh; “but I thought as I came in I heard a sort of laughing
and rustling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother said they often heard him playing and
laughing about the house,” said the old lady. “I told you
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he shan’t want for a bowl of bread and milk to-morrow,
anyhow,” said the Tailor, “if I have to stick to
Farmer Swede’s waistcoat till midnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the waistcoat was finished by bed-time, and the Tailor
set the bread and milk himself, and went to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” said Tommy, when both the boys were in bed,
“the Old Owl was right, and we must stick to it. But I’ll
tell you what I don’t like, and that is, father thinking we’re
idle still. I wish he knew we were the Brownies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Johnnie; and he sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you what,” said Tommy, with the decisiveness of
elder brotherhood, “we’ll keep quiet for a bit for fear we
should leave off; but when we’ve gone on a good while, I
shall tell him. It was only the Old Owl’s grandmother’s
great-grandmother who said it was to be kept secret, and the
Old Owl herself said grandmothers were not always in the
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more they are,” said Johnnie; “look at Granny
about this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Tommy. “She’s in a regular muddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she is,” said Johnnie. “But that’s rather fun, I
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day went by, and still the Brownies “stuck to
it,” and did their work. It is no such very hard matter
after all to get up early when one is young and light-hearted,
and sleeps upon heather in a loft without window-blind, and
with so many broken window-panes that the air comes freely
in. In old times the boys used to play at tents among the
heather, while the Tailor did the house-work; now they
came down and did it for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Size is not everything, even in this material existence.
One has heard of dwarfs who were quite as clever, (not to
say as powerful,) as giants, and I do not fancy that Fairy
Godmothers are ever very large. It is wonderful what a
comfort Brownies may be in the house that is fortunate
enough to hold them! The Tailor’s Brownies were the joy
of his life; and day after day they seemed to grow more and
more ingenious in finding little things to do for his good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now-a-days Granny never picked a scrap for herself. One
day’s shearings were all neatly arranged the next morning,
and laid by her knitting-pins; and the Tailor’s tape and
shears were no more absent without leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day a message came to him to offer him two or three
days’ tailoring in a farmhouse some miles up the valley.
This was pleasant and advantageous sort of work; good food,
sure pay, and a cheerful change; but he did not know how
he could leave his family, unless, indeed, the Brownie might
be relied upon to “keep the house together,” as they say.
The boys were sure that he would, and they promised to set
his water, and to give as little trouble as possible; so, finally,
the Tailor took up his shears and went up the valley, where
the green banks sloped up into purple moor, or broke into
sandy rocks, crowned with nodding oak fern. On to the
prosperous old farm, where he spent a very pleasant time,
sitting level with the window geraniums on a table set apart
for him, stitching and gossiping, gossiping and stitching, and
feeling secure of honest payment when his work was done.
The mistress of the house was a kind good creature, and
loved a chat; and though the Tailor kept his own secret as
to the Brownies, he felt rather curious to know if the Good
People had any hand in the comfort of this flourishing household,
and watched his opportunity to make a few careless inquiries
on the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brownies?” laughed the dame. “Ay, Master, I have
heard of them. When I was a girl, in service at the old
hall, on Cowberry Edge, I heard a good deal of one they
said had lived there in former times. He did housework as
well as a woman, and a good deal quicker, they said. One
night one of the young ladies (that were then, they’re all
dead now,) hid herself in a cupboard, to see what he was
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what was he like?” inquired the Tailor, as composedly
as he was able.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little fellow, they said;” answered the Farmer’s
wife, knitting calmly on. “Like a dwarf, you know, with a
largish head for his body. Not taller than—why, my Bill,
or your eldest boy, perhaps. And he was dressed in rags,
with an old cloak on, and stamping with passion at a cobweb
he couldn’t get at with his broom. They’ve very uncertain
tempers, they say. Tears one minute and laughing the
next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never had one here, I suppose?” said the Tailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not we,” she answered; “and I think I’d rather not.
They’re not canny after all; and my master and me have
always been used to work, and we’ve sons, and daughters to
help us, and that’s better than meddling with the Fairies, to
my mind. No! no!” she added, laughing, “If we had
had one you’d have heard of it, whoever didn’t, for I should
have had some decent clothes made for him. I couldn’t
stand rags and old cloaks, messing and moth-catching in my
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say it’s not lucky to give them clothes, though,”
said the Tailor; “they don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me!” said the dame, “as if any one that liked a
tidy room, wouldn’t like tidy clothes, if they could get them.
No! no! when we have one, you shall take his measure, I
promise you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was all the Tailor got out of her on the subject.
When his work was finished, the Farmer paid him at once;
and the good dame added half a cheese, and a bottle-green
coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That has been laid by for being too small for the master
now he’s so stout,” she said; “but except for a stain or two
it’s good enough, and will cut up like new for one of the
lads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tailor thanked them, and said farewell, and went
home. Down the valley, where the river, wandering
between the green banks and the sandy rocks, was caught by
giant mosses, and bands of fairy fern, and there choked and
struggled, and at last barely escaped with an existence, and
ran away in a diminished stream. On up the purple hills to
the old ruined house. As he came in at the gate he was
struck by some idea of change, and looking again, he saw
that the garden had been weeded, and was comparatively
tidy. The truth is, that Tommy and Johnnie had taken advantage
of the Tailor’s absence to do some Brownie’s work
in the daytime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s that Blessed Brownie!” said the Tailor. “Has he
been as usual?” he asked, when he was in the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure,” said the old lady; “all has been well, Son
Thomas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you what it is,” said the Tailor, after a pause.
“I’m a needy man, but I hope I’m not ungrateful. I can
never repay the Brownie for what he has done for me and
mine; but the mistress up yonder has given me a bottle-green
coat that will cut up as good as new; and as sure as
there’s a Brownie in this house, I’ll make him a suit of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll <span class='it'>what</span>?” shrieked the old lady. “Son Thomas,
Son Thomas, you’re mad! Do what you please for the
Brownies, but never make them clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing they want more,” said the Tailor, “by
all accounts. They’re all in rags, as well they may be,
doing so much work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you make clothes for this Brownie, he’ll go for good,”
said the Grandmother, in a voice of awful warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know,” said her son. “The mistress up
at the farm is clever enough, I can tell you; and as she
said to me, fancy any one that likes a tidy room, not liking
a tidy coat!” For the Tailor, like most men, was apt to
think well of the wisdom of woman-kind in other houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said the old lady, “go your own way. I’m
an old woman, and my time is not long. It doesn’t matter
much to me. But it was new clothes that drove the
Brownie out before, and Trout’s luck went with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, Mother,” said the Tailor, “and I’ve been thinking
of it all the way home; and I can tell you why it was.
Depend upon it, <span class='it'>the clothes didn’t fit</span>. But I’ll tell you what
I mean to do. I shall measure them by Tommy—they say
the Brownies are about his size—and if ever I turned out a
well-made coat and waistcoat, they shall be his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please yourself,” said the old lady, and she would say no
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re quite right, Father,” said Tommy, “and
if I can, I’ll help you to make them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day the father and son set to work, and Tommy contrived
to make himself so useful, that the Tailor hardly
knew how he got through so much work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not like the same thing,” he broke out at last, “to
have some one a bit helpful about you; both for the tailoring
and for company’s sake. I’ve not done such a pleasant
morning’s work since your poor mother died. I’ll tell you
what it is, Tommy,” he added, “if you were always like
this, I shouldn’t much care whether Brownie stayed or went.
I’d give up his help to have yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be back directly,” said Tommy, who burst out of the
room in search of his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come away,” he said squatting down, “because I
can’t bear it. I very nearly let it all out, and I shall soon.
I wish the things weren’t going to come to me,” he added,
kicking a stone in front of him. “I wish he’d measured you,
Johnnie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very glad he didn’t,” said Johnnie. “I wish he’d
kept them himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bottle-green, with brass buttons,” murmured Tommy,
and therewith fell into a reverie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next night the suit was finished, and laid by the
bread and milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see,” said the old lady, in a withering tone.
There is not much real prophetic wisdom in this truism, but
it sounds very awful, and the Tailor went to bed somewhat
depressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning the Brownies came down as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t they look splendid?” said Tommy, feeling the
cloth. “When we’ve tidied the place I shall put them on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But long before the place was tidy, he could wait no longer,
and dressed up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at me!” he shouted; “bottle-green and brass
buttons! Oh, Johnnie, I wish you had some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good thing there are two Brownies,” said Johnnie,
laughing, “and one of them in rags still. I shall do the
work this morning.” And he went flourishing round with a
broom, while Tommy jumped madly about in his new suit.
“Hurrah!” he shouted, “I feel just like the Brownie.
What was it Grannie said he sang when he got his clothes?
Oh, I know—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>‘What have we here? Hemten hamten,</p>
<p class='line0'>Here will I never more tread nor stampen.’ ”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>And on he danced, regardless of the clouds of dust raised by
Johnnie, as he drove the broom indiscriminately over the
floor, to the tune of his own laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was laughter which roused the Tailor that morning,
laughter coming through the floor from the kitchen below.
He scrambled on his things and stole down stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the Brownie,” he thought; “I must look, if it’s for
the last time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the door he paused and listened. The laughter was
mixed with singing, and he heard the words—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“What have we here? Hemten hamten,</p>
<p class='line0'>Here will I never more tread nor stampen.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>He pushed in, and this was the sight that met his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kitchen in its primeval condition of chaos, the untidy
particulars of which were the less apparent, as everything
was more or less obscured by the clouds of dust, where Johnnie
reigned triumphant, like a witch with her broomstick;
and, to crown all, Tommy capering and singing in the
Brownie’s bottle-green suit, brass buttons and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this?” shouted the astonished Tailor, when he
could find breath to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the Brownies,” sang the boys; and on they danced,
for they had worked themselves up into a state of excitement
from which it was not easy to settle down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where <span class='it'>is</span> Brownie?” shouted the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s here,” said Tommy; “we are the Brownies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you stop that fooling?” cried the Tailor, angrily.
“This is past a joke. Where is the real Brownie, I say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are the only Brownies, really, father,” said Tommy,
coming to a full stop, and feeling strongly tempted to run
down from laughing to crying. “Ask the Old Owl. It’s
true, really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tailor saw the boy was in earnest, and passed his
hand over his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I’m getting old,” he said; “I can’t see daylight
through this. If you are the Brownie, who has been
tidying the kitchen lately?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have,” said they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who found my measure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” said Johnnie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who sorts your grandmother’s scraps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do,” said they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who sets breakfast, and puts my things in order?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do,” said they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when do you do it?” asked the Tailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before you come down,” said they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I always have to call you,” said the Tailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We get back to bed again,” said the boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how was it you never did it before!” asked the
Tailor doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were idle, we were idle,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tailor’s voice rose to a pitch of desperation—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you do the work,” he shouted, “<span class='it'>Where is the
Brownie?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here!” cried the boys, “and we are very sorry we
were Boggarts so long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With which the father and sons fell into each other’s arms
and fairly wept.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be believed that to explain all this to the Grandmother
was not the work of a moment. She understood it
all at last, however, and the Tailor could not restrain a little
good-humored triumph on the subject. Before he went to
work he settled her down in the window with her knitting,
and kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of it all, Mother?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bairns are a blessing,” said the old lady, tartly. “<span class='it'>I told
you so.</span>”</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not the end, is it?” asked one of the boys in a
tone of dismay, for the Doctor had paused here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes it is,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But couldn’t you make a little more end?” asked Deordie,
“to tell us what became of them all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see what there is to tell,” said the Doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there’s whether they ever saw the Old Owl again,
and whether Tommy and Johnnie went on being Brownies,”
said the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, be quiet for five minutes,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be as quiet as mice,” said the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as quiet as mice they were. Very like mice, indeed.
Very like mice behind a wainscot at night, when you have
just thrown something to frighten them away. Death-like
stillness for a few seconds, and then all the rustling and
scuffling you please. So the children sat holding their
breath for a moment or two, and then shuffling feet and
smothered bursts of laughter testified to their impatience,
and to the difficulty of understanding the process of story-making
as displayed by the Doctor, who sat pulling his
beard, and staring at his boots, as he made up “a little
more end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, sitting up suddenly, “the Brownies
went on with their work in spite of the bottle-green suit, and
Trout’s luck returned to the old house once more. Before
long Tommy began to work for the farmers, and Baby grew
up into a Brownie, and made (as girls are apt to make) the
best house-sprite of all. For, in the Brownie habits of self-denial,
thoughtfulness, consideration, and the art of little
kindnesses, boys are, I am afraid, as a general rule, somewhat
behindhand with their sisters. Whether this altogether
proceeds from constitutional deficiency on these points in the
masculine character, or is one result among many of the
code of by-laws which obtains in men’s moral education from
the cradle, is a question on which everybody has their own
opinion. For the present the young gentlemen may appropriate
whichever theory they prefer, and we will go back to
the story. The Tailor lived to see his boy-Brownies become
men, with all the cares of a prosperous farm on their hands,
and his girl-Brownie carry her fairy talents into another
home. For these Brownies—young ladies!—are much
desired as wives, whereas a man might as well marry an old
witch as a young Boggartess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And about the Owl?” clamored the children, rather resentful
of the Doctor’s pausing to take breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” he continued, “the Tailor heard the whole
story, and being both anxious to thank the Old Owl for her
friendly offices, and also rather curious to see and hear her,
he went with the boys one night at moon-rise to the shed by
the mere. It was earlier in the evening than when Tommy
went, for before daylight had vanished—and at the first
appearance of the moon, the impatient Tailor was at the
place. There they found the Owl, looking very solemn and
stately on the beam. She was sitting among the shadows
with her shoulders up, and she fixed her eyes so steadily on
the Tailor, that he felt quite overpowered. He made her a
civil bow, however, and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m much obliged to you, Ma’am, for your good advice
to my Tommy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Owl blinked sharply, as if she grudged shutting her
eyes for an instant, and then stared on, but not a word
spoke she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean to intrude, Ma’am,” said the Tailor; “but
I was wishful to pay my respects and gratitude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the Owl gazed in determined silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you remember me?” said Tommy pitifully. “I
did everything you told me. Won’t you even say good-bye?”
and he went up towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Owl’s eyes contracted, she shuddered a few tufts of
fluff into the shed, shook her wings, and shouting “Oohoo!”
at the top of her voice, flew out upon the moor. The Tailor
and his sons rushed out to watch her. They could see her
clearly against the green twilight sky, flapping rapidly away
with her round face to the pale moon. “Good-bye!” they
shouted as she disappeared; first the departing owl, then a
shadowy body with flapping sails, then two wings beating
the same measured time, then two moving lines still to the
old tune, then a stroke, a fancy, and then—the green sky
and the pale moon, but the Old Owl was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she never come back?” asked Tiny in subdued
tones, for the Doctor had paused again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he; “at least not to the shed by the mere.
Tommy saw many owls after this in the course of his life;
but as none of them would speak, and as most of them were
addicted to the unconventional customs of staring and winking,
he could not distinguish his friend, if she were among them.
And now I think that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the very very end?” asked Tiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The very very end,” said the Doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose there might be more and more ends,” speculated
Deordie—“about whether the Brownies had any children
when they grew into farmers, and whether the children
were Brownies, and whether <span class='it'>they</span> had other Brownies, and
so on and on.” And Deordie rocked himself among the
geraniums, in the luxurious imagination of an endless fairy
tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You insatiable rascal!” said the Doctor. “Not another
word. Jump up, for I’m going to see you home. I have to
be off early to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” said Deordie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind. I shall be away all day, and I want to be
at home in good time in the evening, for I mean to attack
that crop of groundsel between the sweet-pea hedges. You
know, no Brownies come to my homestead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Doctor’s mouth twitched a little till he fixed it
into a stiff smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children tried hard to extract some more ends out of
him on the way to the Rectory; but he declined to pursue
the history of the Trout family through indefinite generations.
It was decided on all hands, however, that Tommy
Trout was evidently one and the same with Tommy Trout
who pulled the cat out of the well, because “it was just a
sort of thing for a Brownie to do, you know!” and that
Johnnie Green (who, of course, was not Johnnie Trout,)
was some unworthy village acquaintance, and “a thorough
Boggart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor!” said Tiny, as they stood by the garden-gate,
“how long do you think gentlemen’s pocket-handkerchiefs
take to wear out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, my dear Madam,” said the Doctor, “must depend,
like other terrestrial matters, upon circumstances; whether
the gentleman bought fine cambric, or coarse cotton with
pink portraits of the reigning Sovereign, to commence with;
whether he catches many colds, has his pocket picked, takes
snuff, or allows his washerwoman to use washing powders.
But why do you want to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t tell you that,” said Tiny, who was spoilt by the
Doctor, and consequently tyrannized in proportion; “but I
will tell you what I mean to do. I mean to tell Mother that
when Father wants any more pocket handkerchiefs hemmed,
she had better put them by the bath in the nursery, and perhaps
some Brownie will come and do them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kiss my fluffy face!” said the Doctor in sepulchral
tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The owl is too high up,” said Tiny, tossing her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor lifted her four feet or so, obtained his kiss,
and set her down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not fluffy at all,” said she in a tone of the utmost
contempt; “you’re tickly and bristly. Puss is more fluffy,
and Father is scrubby and scratchy, because he shaves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And which of the three styles do you prefer?” said the
Doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not tickly and bristly,” said Tiny with firmness, and
she strutted up the walk for a pace or two, and then turned
round to laugh over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night!” shouted her victim, shaking his fist after
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other children took a noisy farewell, and they all
raced into the house, to give joint versions of the fairy tale,
first to the parents in the drawing-room, and then to nurse
in the nursery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor went home also, with his poodle at his heels,
but not by the way he came. He went out of his way,
which was odd; but then the Doctor was “a little odd,”
and moreover this was always the end of his evening walk.
Through the church-yard, where spreading cedars and stiff
yews rose from the velvet grass, and where among tombstones
and crosses of various devices lay one of older and
uglier date, by which he stayed. It was framed by a border
of the most brilliant flowers, and it would seem as if the
Doctor must have been the gardener, for he picked off some
dead ones, and put them absently in his pocket. Then he
looked round, as if to see that he was alone. Not a soul
was to be seen, and the moonlight and shadow lay quietly
side by side, as the dead do in their graves. The Doctor
stooped down and took off his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Marcia,” he said, in a low quiet voice.
“Good-night, my darling!” The dog licked his hand, but
there was no voice to answer, nor any that regarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor foolish Doctor! Most foolish to speak to the departed
with his face earthwards. But we are weak mortals,
the best of us; and this man (one of the very best) raised
his head at last, and went home like a lonely owl with his
face to the moon and the sky.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A BORROWED BROWNIE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>I can’t</span> imagine,” said the Rector, walking into the
drawing-room the following afternoon; “I can’t imagine
where Tiny is. I want her to drive to the other end of the
parish with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There she comes,” said his wife, looking out of the
window, “by the garden-gate, with a great basket; what has
she been after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rector went out to discover, and met his daughter
looking decidedly earthy, and seemingly much exhausted by
the weight of a basketful of groundsel plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you been?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Doctor’s garden,” said Tiny triumphantly; “and
look what I have done? I’ve weeded his sweet-peas, and
brought away the groundsel; so when he gets home to-night
he’ll think a Brownie has been in the garden, for Mrs.
Pickles has promised not to tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look here!” said the Rector, affecting a great
appearance of severity, “you’re my Brownie, not his.
Supposing Tommy Trout had gone and weeded Farmer
Swede’s garden, and brought back his weeds to go to seed
on the Tailor’s flower-beds, how do you think he would have
liked it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tiny looked rather crestfallen. When one has fairly
carried through a splendid benevolence of this kind, it is
trying to find oneself in the wrong. She crept up to the
Rector, however, and put her golden head upon his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Father dear,” she pleaded, “I didn’t mean not to
be your Brownie; only, you know, you had got five left at
home, and it was only for a short time, and the Doctor hasn’t
any Brownie at all. Don’t you pity him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Rector, who was old enough to remember that
grave-stone story we wot of, hugged his Brownie in his arms,
and answered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Darling, I do pity him!”</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE NURSERY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was certainly an aggravated offence. It is generally
understood in families that “boys will be boys,” but there is
a limit to the forbearance implied in the extenuating axiom.
Master Sam was condemned to the back nursery for the rest
of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He always had had the knack of breaking his own toys,—he
not unfrequently broke other people’s; but accidents will
happen, and his twin sister and factotum, Dot, was long-suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dot was fat, resolute, hasty, and devotedly unselfish.
When Sam scalped her new doll, and fastened the glossy
black curls to a wigwam improvised with the curtains of the
four-post bed in the best bedroom, Dot was sorely tried. As
her eyes passed from the crownless doll on the floor to the floss-silk
ringlets hanging from the bed-furniture, her round rosy face
grew rounder and rosier, and tears burst from her eyes. But
in a moment more she clenched her little fists, forced back the
tears, and gave vent to her favorite saying, “I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That sentence was Dot’s bane and antidote; it was her vice
and her virtue. It was her standing consolation, and it
brought her into all her scrapes. It was her one panacea for
all the ups and downs of her life (and in the nursery where
Sam developed his organ of destructiveness there were ups
and downs not a few); and it was the form her naughtiness
took when she was naughty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t care fell into a goose-pond, Miss Dot,” said nurse,
on one occasion of the kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care if he did,” said Miss Dot; and as nurse
knew no further feature of the goose-pond adventure which
met this view of it, she closed the subject by putting Dot into
the corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the strength of <span class='it'>Don’t care</span>, and her love for Sam, Dot
bore much and long. Her dolls perished by ingenious but
untimely deaths. Her toys were put to purposes for which
they were never intended, and suffered accordingly. But
Sam was penitent, and Dot was heroic. Florinda’s scalp was
mended with a hot knitting-needle and a perpetual bonnet,
and Dot rescued her paint-brushes from the glue-pot, and
smelt her India-rubber as it boiled down in Sam’s water-proof
manufactory, with long-suffering forbearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are, however, as we have said, limits to everything.
An earthquake celebrated with the whole contents of the toy
cupboard is not to be borne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The matter was this. Early one morning Sam announced
that he had a glorious project on hand. He was going to
give a grand show and entertainment, far surpassing all the
nursery imitations of circuses, conjurors, lectures on chemistry,
and so forth, with which they had ever amused themselves.
He refused to confide his plans to the faithful Dot;
but he begged her to lend him all the toys she possessed, in
return for which she was to be the sole spectator of the fun.
He let out that the idea had suggested itself to him after the
sight of a Diorama to which they had been taken, but he
would not allow that it was anything of the same kind; in
proof of which she was at liberty to keep back her paint-box.
Dot tried hard to penetrate the secret, and to reserve
some of her things from the general conscription. But Sam
was obstinate. He would tell nothing, and he wanted everything.
The dolls, the bricks (especially the bricks), the tea-things,
the German farm, the Swiss cottages, the animals, and
all the dolls’ furniture. Dot gave them with a doubtful
mind, and consoled herself as she watched Sam carrying
pieces of board and a green table cover into the back nursery,
with the prospect of a show. At last, Sam threw open the
door and ushered her into the nursery rocking-chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy had certainly some constructive as well as destructive
talent. Upon a sort of impromptu table covered
with green cloth he had arranged all the toys in rough imitation
of a town, with its streets and buildings. The relative
proportion of the parts was certainly not good; but it was
not Sam’s fault that the doll’s house and the German farm,
his own brick buildings, and the Swiss cottages, were all on
totally different scales of size. He had ingeniously put the larger
things in the foreground, keeping the small farm-buildings
from the German box at the far end of the streets, yet after
all the perspective was extreme. The effect of three large
horses from the toy stables in front, with the cows from the
small Noah’s Ark in the distance, was admirable; but the
big dolls seated in an unroofed building, made with the
wooden bricks on no architectural principle but that of a
pound, and taking tea out of the new china tea-things, looked
simply ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dot’s eyes, however, saw no defects, and she clapped vehemently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, ladies and gentlemen,” said Sam, waving his hand
politely towards the rocking-chair, “you see the great city
of Lisbon, the capital of Portugal——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this display of geographical accuracy Dot fairly cheered,
and rocked herself to and fro in unmitigated enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“——as it appeared,” continued the showman, “on the
morning of November 1st, 1755.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never having had occasion to apply Mangnall’s Questions
to the exigencies of every-day life, this date in no way disturbed
Dot’s comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this house,” Sam proceeded, “a party of Portuguese
ladies of rank may be seen taking tea together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Breakfast</span>, you mean,” said Dot; “you said it was in the
morning, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they took tea to their breakfast,” said Sam.
“Don’t interrupt me. You are the audience, and you
mustn’t speak. Here you see the horses of the English ambassador
out airing with his groom. There you see two peasants—no!
they are <span class='it'>not</span> Noah and his wife, Dot, and if you go on
talking I shall shut up. I say they are peasants peacefully
driving cattle. At this moment a rumbling sound startles
every one in the city”—here Sam rolled some croquet balls up
and down in a box, but the dolls sat as quiet as before, and
Dot alone was startled,—“this was succeeded by a slight
shock”—here he shook the table, which upset some of the
buildings belonging to the German farm.—“Some houses fell.”—Dot
began to look anxious.—“This shock was followed by
several others.”—“Take care,” she begged—“of increasing
magnitude”—“Oh, Sam!” Dot shrieked, jumping up,
“you’re breaking the china!”—“The largest buildings shook
to their foundations,”—“Sam! Sam! the doll’s house is falling,”
Dot cried, making wild efforts to save it: but Sam held
her back with one arm, whilst with the other he began to pull
at the boards which formed his table—“Suddenly the ground
split and opened with a fearful yawn”—Dot’s shrieks shamed
the impassive dolls, as Sam jerked out the boards by a dextrous
movement, and doll’s house, brick buildings, the farm,
the Swiss cottages, and the whole toy-stock of the nursery,
sank together in ruins. Quite unabashed by the evident
damage, Sam continued—“and in a moment the whole magnificent
city of Lisbon was swallowed up. Dot! Dot! don’t
be a muff! What’s the matter? It’s splendid fun. Things
must be broken sometime, and I’m sure it was exactly like
the real thing. Dot! why don’t you speak? Dot! my dear
Dot! You don’t care, do you? I didn’t think you’d mind
it so. It was such a splendid earthquake. Oh! try not to
go on like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dot’s feelings were far beyond her own control, much
more that of Master Sam, at this moment. She was gasping
and choking, and when at last she found breath it was only
to throw herself on her face upon the floor with bitter and
uncontrollable sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was certainly a mild punishment that condemned Master
Sam to the back nursery for the rest of the day. It had,
however, this additional severity, that during the afternoon
Aunt Penelope was expected to arrive.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AUNT PENELOPE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Aunt Penelope</span> was one of those dear, good souls, who,
single themselves, have, as real or adopted relatives, the
interests of a dozen families, instead of one, at heart. There
are few people whose youth has not owned the influence of
at least one such friend. It may be a good habit, the first
interest in some life-loved pursuit or favorite author, some
pretty feminine art, or delicate womanly counsel enforced by
those narratives of real life that are more interesting than
any fiction: it may be only the periodical return of gifts and
kindness, and the store of family histories that no one else
can tell; but we all owe something to such an aunt or uncle—the
fairy godmothers of real life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The benefits which Sam and Dot reaped from Aunt Penelope’s
visits, may be summed up under the heads of presents
and stories, with a general leaning to indulgence in the matters
of punishment, lessons, and going to bed, which perhaps
is natural to aunts and uncles who have no positive responsibilities
in the young people’s education, and are not the daily
sufferers by the lack of due discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope’s presents were lovely. Aunt Penelope’s
stories were charming. There was generally a moral
wrapped up in them, like the motto in a cracker-bonbon;
but it was quite in the inside, so to speak, and there was
abundance of smart paper and sugar-plums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All things considered, it was certainly most proper that
the much-injured Dot should be dressed out in her best, and
have access to dessert, the dining-room, and Aunt Penelope,
whilst Sam was kept upstairs. And yet it was Dot who
(her first burst of grief being over), fought stoutly for his
pardon all the time she was being dressed, and was afterwards
detected in the act of endeavoring to push fragments
of raspberry tart through the nursery key-hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='sc'>GOOD</span> thing!” Sam emphatically exclaimed, as he
heard her in fierce conflict on the other side of the door with
the nurse who found her—“You <span class='sc'>GOOD</span> thing! leave me
alone, for I deserve it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He really was very penitent. He was too fond of Dot not
to regret the unexpected degree of distress he had caused her;
and Dot made much of his penitence in her intercessions in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sam is so very sorry,” she said, “he says he knows he
deserves it. I think he ought to come down. He is so <span class='it'>very</span>
sorry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penelope, as usual, took the lenient side, joining her
entreaties to Dot’s, and it ended in Master Sam’s being
hurriedly scrubbed and brushed, and shoved into his black
velvet suit, and sent downstairs, rather red about the eyelids,
and looking very sheepish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dot!” he exclaimed, as soon as he could get her
into a corner, “I am so very, very sorry! particularly about
the tea-things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said Dot, “I don’t care; and I’ve asked
for a story, and we’re going into the library.” As Dot said
this, she jerked her head expressively in the direction of the
sofa, where Aunt Penelope was just casting on stitches
preparatory to beginning a pair of her famous ribbed socks
for Papa, whilst she gave to Mamma’s conversation that
sympathy, which (like her knitting-needles) was always at
the service of her large circle of friends. Dot anxiously
watched the bow on the top of her cap as it danced and
nodded with the force of Mamma’s observations. At last it
gave a little chorus of jerks, as one should say, “Certainly,
undoubtedly.” And then the story came to an end, and Dot,
who had been slowly creeping nearer, fairly took Aunt Penelope
by the hand, and carried her off, knitting and all, to the
library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, please,” said Dot, when she had struggled into a
chair that was too tall for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop a minute!” cried Sam, who was perched in the
opposite one, “the horsehair tickles my legs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put your pocket-handkerchief under them, as I do,” said
Dot. “<span class='it'>Now</span>, Aunt Penelope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, wait,” groaned Sam; “it isn’t big enough; it only
covers one leg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dot slid down again, and ran to Sam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take my handkerchief for the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what will you do?” said Sam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t care,” said Dot, scrambling back into her
place. “Now, Aunty, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Aunt Penelope began.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LAND OF LOST TOYS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>I suppose</span> people who have children transfer their childish
follies and fancies to them, and become properly sedate
and grown-up. Perhaps it is because I am an old maid,
and have none, that some of my nursery whims stick to me,
and I find myself liking things, and wanting things, quite out
of keeping with my cap and time of life. For instance.
Anything in the shape of a toy-shop (from a London bazaar
to a village window, with Dutch dolls, leather balls, and
wooden battle-dores) quite unnerves me, so to speak. When
I see one of those boxes containing a jar, a churn, a kettle,
a pan, a coffee-pot, a cauldron on three legs, and sundry
dishes, all of the smoothest wood, and with the immemorial
red flower on one side of each vessel, I fairly long for an
excuse for playing with them, and for trying (positively for
the last time) if the lids <span class='it'>do</span> come off, and whether the kettle
will (literally, as well as metaphorically) hold water. Then
if, by good or ill luck, there is a child flattening its little nose
against the window with longing eyes, my purse is soon
empty; and as it toddles off with a square parcel under one
arm, and a lovely being in black ringlets and white tissue
paper in the other, I wish that I were worthy of being asked
to join the ensuing play. Don’t suppose there is any
generosity in this. I have only done what we are all glad to
do. I have found an excuse for indulging a pet weakness.
As I said, it is not merely the new and expensive toys that
attract me; I think my weakest corner is where the penny
boxes lie, the wooden tea-things (with the above-named
flower in miniature), the soldiers on their lazy tongs, the
nine-pins, and the tiny farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need hardly say that the toy booth in a village fair
tries me very hard. It tried me in childhood, when I was
often short of pence, and when ‘the Feast’ came once a
year. It never tried me more than on one occasion, lately,
when I was revisiting my old home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was deep Midsummer, and the Feast. I had children
with me of course (I find children, somehow, wherever I go),
and when we got into the fair, there were children of people
whom I had known as children, with just the same love for
a monkey going up one side of a yellow stick and coming
down the other, and just as strong heads for a giddy-go-round
on a hot day and a diet of peppermint lozenges, as
their fathers and mothers before them. There were the
very same names—and here and there it seemed the very
same faces—I knew so long ago. A few shillings were indeed
well expended in brightening those familiar eyes: and
then there were the children with me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides,
there really did seem to be an unusually nice assortment of
things, and the man was very intelligent (in reference to his
wares: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, well! It was two o’clock <span style='font-size:smaller'>P. M.</span>
when we went in at one end of that glittering avenue of
drums, dolls, trumpets, accordions, work-boxes and what
not; but what o’clock it was when I came out at the other
end, with a shilling and some coppers in my pocket, and was
cheered, I can’t say, though I should like to have been able
to be accurate about the time, because of what followed.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought the best thing I could do was to get out of the
fair at once, so I went up the village and struck off across
some fields into a little wood that lay near. (A favorite
walk in old times.) As I turned out of the booth, my foot
struck against one of the yellow sticks of the climbing
monkeys. The monkey was gone, and the stick broken.
It set me thinking as I walked along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an untold number of pretty and ingenious things
one does (not wear out in honorable wear and tear, but)
utterly lose, and wilfully destroy, in one’s young days—things
that would have given pleasure to so many more
young eyes, if they had been kept a little longer—things
that one would so value in later years, if some of them had
survived the dissipating and destructive days of Nurserydom.
I recalled a young lady I knew, whose room was adorned
with knick-knacks of a kind I had often envied. They
were not plaster figures, old china, wax-work flowers under a
glass, or ordinary ornaments of any kind. They were her
old toys. Perhaps she had not had many of them, and had
been the more careful of those she had. She had certainly
been very fond of them, and had kept more of them than
any one I ever knew. A faded doll slept in its cradle at the
foot of her bed. A wooden elephant stood on the dressing-table,
and a poodle that had lost his bark put out a red-flannel
tongue with quixotic violence at a windmill on the
opposite corner of the mantelpiece. Everything had a story
of its own. Indeed the whole room must have been redolent
with the sweet story of childhood, of which the toys
were the illustrations, or like a poem of which the toys were
the verses. She used to have children to play with them
sometimes, and this was a high honor. She is married now,
and has children of her own, who on birthdays and holidays
will forsake the newest of their own possessions to play with
‘mamma’s toys.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was roused from these recollections by the pleasure of
getting into the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I have a stronger predilection than my love for toys,
it is my love for woods, and, like the other, it dates from
childhood. It was born and bred with me, and I fancy will
stay with me till I die. The soothing scents of leaf mould,
moss, and fern (not to speak of flowers)—the pale green
veil in spring, the rich shade in summer, the rustle of the
dry leaves in autumn, I suppose an old woman may enjoy
all these, my dears, as well as you. But I think I could
make ‘fairy jam’ of hips and haws in acorn cups now, if
any child would be condescending enough to play with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>This</span> wood, too, had associations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I strolled on in leisurely enjoyment, and at last seated
myself at the foot of a tree to rest. I was hot and tired;
partly with the mid-day heat and the atmosphere of the fair,
partly with the exertion of calculating change in the purchase
of articles ranging in price from three farthings upwards.
The tree under which I sat was an old friend.
There was a hole at its base that I knew well. Two roots
covered with exquisite moss ran out from each side, like the
arms of a chair, and between them there accumulated year
after year a rich, though tiny store of dark leaf-mould. We
always used to say that fairies lived within, though I never
saw anything go in myself but wood beetles. There was
one going in at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How little the wood was changed! I bent my head for
a few seconds, and, closing my eyes, drank in the delicious
and suggestive scents of earth and moss about the dear old
tree. I had been so long parted from the place that I could
hardly believe that I was in the old familiar spot. Surely it
was only one of the many dreams in which I had played
again beneath those trees! But when I reopened my eyes
there was the same hole, and, oddly enough, the same beetle
or one just like it. I had not noticed till that moment how
much larger the hole was than it used to be in my young
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I suppose the rain and so forth wears them away in
time,’ I said vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Suppose it does,’ said the beetle politely; ‘will you
walk in?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know why I was not so overpoweringly astonished
as you would imagine. I think I was a good deal
absorbed in considering the size of the hole, and the very
foolish wish that seized me to do what I had often longed to
do in childhood, and creep in. I <span class='it'>had</span> so much regard for
propriety as to see that there was no one to witness the escapade.
Then I tucked my skirts round me, put my spectacles
into my pocket for fear they should get broken, and in I
went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must say one thing. A wood is charming enough (no
one appreciates it more than myself), but, if you have
never been there, you have no idea how much nicer it is
inside than on the surface. Oh, the mosses—the gorgeous
mosses! The fretted lichens! The fungi like flowers for
beauty, and the flowers like nothing you have ever seen!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where the beetle went to I don’t know. I could stand
up now quite well, and I wandered on till dusk in unwearied
admiration. I was among some large beeches as it grew
dark, and was beginning to wonder how I should find my
way (not that I had lost it, having none to lose), when suddenly
lights burst from every tree, and the whole place was
illuminated. The nearest approach to this scene that I ever
witnessed above ground was in a wood near the Hague in
Holland. There, what look like tiny glass tumblers holding
floating wicks, are fastened to the trunks of the fine old
trees, at intervals of sufficient distance to make the light and
shade mysterious, and to give effect to the full blaze when
you reach the spot where the hanging chains of lamps illuminate
the ‘Pavilion’ and the open space where the band
plays, and where the townsfolk assemble by hundreds to drink
coffee and enjoy the music. I was the more reminded of the
Dutch ‘bosch’ because, after wandering some time among
the lighted trees, I heard distant sounds of music, and came
at last upon a glade lit up in a similar manner, except that
the whole effect was incomparably more brilliant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I stood for a moment doubting whether I should
proceed, and a good deal puzzled about the whole affair, I
caught sight of a large spider crouched up in a corner with
his stomach on the ground and his knees above his head, as
some spiders do sit, and looking at me, as I fancied, through
a pair of spectacles. (About the spectacles I do not feel
sure. It may have been two of his bent legs in apparent
connection with his prominent eyes.) I thought of the
beetle, and said civilly, ‘Can you tell me, sir, if this is
Fairyland?’ The spider took off his spectacles (or untucked
his legs), and took a sideways run out of his corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ he said, ‘it’s a Providence. The fact is, it’s the
Land of Lost Toys. You haven’t such a thing as a fly anywhere
about you, have you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No,’ I said, ‘I’m sorry to say I have not.’ This was
not strictly true, for I was not at all sorry; but I wished to
be civil to the old gentleman, for he projected his eyes at me
with such an intense (I had almost said greedy) gaze, that I
felt quite frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How did you pass the sentries?’ he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I never saw any,’ I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You couldn’t have seen anything if you didn’t see
them,’ he said; ‘but perhaps you don’t know. They’re the
glow-worms. Six to each tree, so they light the road, and
challenge the passers-by. Why didn’t they challenge you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t know,’ I began, ‘unless the beetle——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t like beetles,’ interrupted the spider, stretching
each leg in turn by sticking it up above him, ‘all shell and
no flavor. You never tried walking on anything of that sort,
did you?’ and he pointed with one leg to a long thread that
fastened a web above his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Certainly not,’ said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m afraid it wouldn’t bear you,’ he observed slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m quite sure it wouldn’t,’ I hastened to reply. ‘I
wouldn’t try for worlds. It would spoil your pretty work in
a moment. Good-evening.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I hurried forward. Once I looked back, but the
spider was not following me. He was in his hole again, on
his stomach, with his knees above his head, and looking
(apparently through his spectacles) down the road up which
I came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I soon forgot him in the sight before me. I had reached
the open place with the lights and the music; but how shall I
describe the spectacle that I beheld?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have spoken of the effect of a toy-shop on my feelings.
Now imagine a toy-fair, brighter and gayer than the brightest
bazaar ever seen, held in an open glade, where forest-trees
stood majestically behind the glittering stalls, and
stretched their gigantic arms above our heads, brilliant with
a thousand hanging lamps. At the moment of my entrance
all was silent and quiet. The toys lay in their places looking
so incredibly attractive that I reflected with disgust that
all my ready cash, except one shilling and some coppers, had
melted away amid the tawdry fascinations of a village booth.
I was counting the coppers (sevenpence halfpenny), when
all in a moment a dozen sixpenny fiddles leaped from their
places and began to play, accordions of all sizes joined them,
the drumsticks beat upon the drums, the penny trumpets
sounded, and yellow flutes took up the melody on high notes,
and bore it away through the trees. It was weird fairy-music
but quite delightful. The nearest approach to it that
I know of above ground is to hear a wild dreamy air very
well whistled to a pianoforte accompaniment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the music began, all the toys rose. The dolls
jumped down and began to dance. The poodles barked, the
pannier donkeys wagged their ears, the windmills turned,
the puzzles put themselves together, the bricks built houses,
the balls flew from side to side, the battle-doors and shuttle-cocks
kept it up among themselves, and the skipping-ropes
went round, the hoops ran off, and the sticks went after them,
the cobbler’s wax at the tails of all the green frogs gave
way, and they jumped at the same moment, whilst an old-fashioned
go-cart ran madly about with nobody inside. It
was most exhilarating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I soon became aware that the beetle was once more at
my elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There are some beautiful toys here,’ I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, yes,’ he replied, ‘and some odd-looking ones, too.
You see, whatever has been really used by any child as a
plaything gets a right to come down here in the end; and
there is some very queer company, I assure you. Look
there.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I looked, and said, ‘It seems to be a potato.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So it is,’ said the beetle. ‘It belonged to an Irish
child in one of your great cities. But to whom the child
belonged I don’t know, and I don’t think he knew himself.
He lived in a corner of a dirty, over-crowded room, and into
this corner, one day, the potato rolled. It was the only
plaything he ever had. He stuck two cinders into it for
eyes, scraped a nose and mouth, and loved it. He sat upon it
during the day, for fear it should be taken from him, but in
the dark he took it out and played with it. He was often
hungry, but he never ate that potato. When he died it
rolled out of the corner, and was swept into the ashes.
Then it came down here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What a sad story!’ I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The beetle seemed in no way affected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It is a curious thing,’ he rambled on, ‘that potato
takes quite a good place among the toys. You see, rank and
precedence down here is entirely a question of age; that
is, of the length of time that any plaything has been in the
possession of a child; and all kinds of ugly old things hold
the first rank; whereas the most costly and beautiful works
of art have often been smashed or lost, by the spoilt children
of rich people, in two or three days. If you care for sad
stories, there is another queer thing belonging to a child
who died.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appeared to be a large sheet of canvas with some
strange kind of needlework upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It belonged to a little girl in a rich household,’ the
beetle continued; ‘she was an invalid, and difficult to amuse.
We have lots of her toys, and very pretty ones too. At last
some one taught her to make caterpillars in wool-work. A
bit of work was to be done in a certain stitch and then cut
with scissors, which made it look like a hairy caterpillar.
The child took to this, and cared for nothing else. Wool of
every shade was procured for her, and she made caterpillars
of all colors. Her only complaint was that they did not
turn into butterflies. However, she was a sweet, gentle-tempered
child, and she went on, hoping that they would do
so, and making new ones. One day she was heard talking
and laughing in her bed for joy. She said that all the caterpillars
had become butterflies of many colors, and that the
room was full of them. In that happy fancy she died.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And the caterpillars came down here?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Not for a long time,’ said the beetle; ‘her mother kept
them while <span class='it'>she</span> lived, and then they were lost and came
down. No toys come down here till they are broken or
lost.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What are those sticks doing here?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The music had ceased, and all the toys were lying quiet.
Up in a corner leaned a large bundle of walking-sticks.
They are often sold in toy-shops, but I wondered on what
grounds they came here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Did you ever meet with a too benevolent old gentleman
wondering where on earth his sticks go to?’ said the beetle.
‘Why do they lend them to their grandchildren? The
young rogues use them as hobby-horses and lose them, and
down they come, and the sentinels cannot stop them. The
real hobby-horses won’t allow them to ride with them, however.
There was a meeting on the subject. Every stick
was put through an examination. ‘Where is your nose?
Where is your mane? Where are your wheels?’ The last
was a poser. Some of them had got noses, but none of
them had got wheels. So they were not true hobby-horses.
Something of the kind occurred with the elder
whistles.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The what?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Whistles that boys make of elder sticks with the pith
scooped out,’ said the beetle. ‘The real instruments would
not allow them to play with them. The elder-whistles said
they would not have joined had they been asked. They
were amateurs, and never played with professionals. So
they have private concerts with the combs and curl-papers.
But, bless you, toys of this kind are endless here! Teetotums
made of old cotton reels, tea-sets of acorn cups, dinner-sets
of old shells, monkeys made of bits of sponge, all sorts
of things made of breastbones and merrythoughts, old packs
of cards that are always building themselves into houses
and getting knocked down when the band begins to play,
feathers, rabbits’ tails——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ah! I have heard about rabbits’ tails,’ I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There they are,’ the beetle continued; ‘and when the
band plays you will see how they skip and run. I don’t believe
you would find out that they had no bodies, for my experience
of a warren is, that when rabbits skip and run it is the
tails chiefly that you do see. But of all the amateur toys
the most successful are the boats. We have a lake for our
craft, you know, and there’s quite a fleet of boats made out
of old cork floats in fishing villages. Then, you see, the old
bits of cork have really been to sea, and seen a good deal of
service on the herring nets, and so they quite take the lead
of the smart shop ships, that have never been beyond a pond
or a tub of water. But that’s an exception. Amateur toys
are mostly very dowdy. Look at that box.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I looked, thought I must have seen it before, and wondered
why a very common-looking box without a lid should
affect me so strangely, and why my memory should seem
struggling to bring it back out of the past. Suddenly it
came to me—it was our old Toy Box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had completely forgotten that nursery institution till
recalled by the familiar aspect of the inside, which was papered
with proof-sheets of some old novel on which black
stars had been stamped by way of ornament. Dim memories
of how these stars, and the angles of the box, and certain
projecting nails interfered with the letter-press and defeated
all attempts to trace the thread of the nameless narrative,
stole back over my brain; and I seemed once more,
with my head in the Toy Box, to beguile a wet afternoon by
apoplectic endeavors to follow the fortunes of Sir Charles
and Lady Belinda, as they took a favorable turn in the left-hand
corner at the bottom of the trunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What are you staring at?’ said the beetle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s my old Toy Box!’ I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The beetle rolled on to his back, and struggled helplessly
with his legs: I turned him over. (Neither the first nor the
last time of my showing that attention to beetles.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s right,’ he said, ‘set me on my legs. What a
turn you gave me! You don’t mean to say you have any
toys here? If you have, the sooner you make your way
home the better.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why?’ I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ he said, ‘there’s a very strong feeling in the
place. The toys think that they are ill-treated, and not
taken care of by children in general. And there is some
truth in it. Toys come down here by scores that have been
broken the first day. And they are all quite resolved that
if any of their old masters or mistresses come this way they
shall be punished.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How will they be punished?’ I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Exactly as they did to their toys, their toys will do to
them. All is perfectly fair and regular.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t know that I treated mine particularly badly,’ I
said; ‘but I think I would rather go.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I think you’d better,’ said the beetle. ‘Good-evening!’
and I saw him no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I turned to go, but somehow I lost the road. At last,
as I thought, I found it, and had gone a few steps when I
came on a detachment of wooden soldiers, drawn up on their
lazy tongs. I thought it better to wait till they got out of
the way, so I turned back, and sat down in a corner in some
alarm. As I did so, I heard a click, and the lid of a small
box covered with mottled paper burst open, and up jumped
a figure in a blue striped shirt and a rabbit-skin beard,
whose eyes were intently fixed on me. He was very like my
old Jack-in-a-box. My back began to creep, and I wildly
meditated escape, frantically trying at the same time to recall
whether it were I or my brother who originated the idea
of making a small bonfire of our own one 5th of November,
and burning the old Jack-in-a-box for Guy Fawkes, till
nothing was left of him but a twirling bit of red-hot wire
and a strong smell of frizzled fur. At this moment he nodded
to me and spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh! that’s you, is it?’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, it is not,’ I answered, hastily; for I was quite demoralized
by fear and the strangeness of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who is it, then?’ he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m sure I don’t know,’ I said; and really I was so
confused that I hardly did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, <span class='it'>we</span> know,’ said the Jack-in-a-box, ‘and that’s all
that’s needed. Now, my friends,’ he continued, addressing
the toys who had begun to crowd round us, ‘whoever recognizes
a mistress and remembers a grudge—the hour of our
revenge has come. Can we any of us forget the treatment
we received at her hands? No! When we think of the
ingenious fancy, the patient skill, that went to our manufacture;
that fitted the delicate joints and springs, laid on the
paint and varnish, and gave back-hair combs, and ear-rings
to our smallest dolls, we feel that we deserved more care
than we received. When we reflect upon the kind friends
who bought us with their money, and gave us away in the
benevolence of their hearts, we know that for their sakes we
ought to have been longer kept and better valued. And
when we remember that the sole object of our own existence
was to give pleasure and amusement to our possessors, we
have no hesitation in believing that we deserved a handsomer
return than to have had our springs broken, our paint
dirtied, and our earthly careers so untimely shortened by
wilful mischief or fickle neglect. My friends, the prisoner
is at the bar.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am not,’ I said; for I was determined not to give in
as long as resistance was possible. But as I said it I became
aware, to my unutterable amazement, that I was inside the
go-cart. How I got there is to this moment a mystery to
me—but there I was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a great deal of excitement about the Jack-in-a-box’s
speech. It was evident that he was considered an
orator, and, indeed, I have seen counsel in a real court look
wonderfully like him. Meanwhile, my old toys appeared to
be getting together. I had no idea that I had had so many.
I had really been very fond of most of them, and my heart
beat as the sight of them recalled scenes long forgotten, and
took me back to childhood and home. There were my little
gardening tools, and my slate, and there was the big doll’s
bedstead, that had a real mattress, and real sheets and
blankets, all marked with the letter D, and a workbasket
made in the blind school, and a shilling School of Art paint
box, and a wooden doll we used to call the Dowager, and
innumerable other toys which I had forgotten till the sight
of them recalled them to my memory, but which have again
passed from my mind. Exactly opposite to me stood the
Chinese mandarin, nodding as I had never seen him nod
since the day when I finally stopped his performances by ill-directed
efforts to discover how he did it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what was that familiar figure among the rest, in a
yellow silk dress and maroon velvet cloak and hood trimmed
with black lace? How those clothes recalled the friends
who gave them to me! And surely this was no other than
my dear doll Rosa—the beloved companion of five years of
my youth, whose hair I wore in a locket after I was grown
up. No one could say I had ill-treated <span class='it'>her</span>. Indeed, she
fixed her eyes on me with a most encouraging smile—but
then she always smiled, her mouth was painted so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘All whom it may concern, take notice,’ shouted the
Jack-in-a-box, at this point, ‘that the rule of this honorable
court is tit for tat.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Tit, tat, tumble two,’ muttered the slate in a cracked
voice. (How well I remembered the fall that cracked it,
and the sly games of tit tat that varied the monotony of our
long multiplication sums!)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What are you talking about?’ said the Jack-in-a-box,
sharply; ‘if you have grievances, state them, and you shall
have satisfaction, as I told you before.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘——and five make nine,’ added the slate promptly,
‘and six are fifteen, and eight are twenty-seven—there we go
again! I wonder why I never get up to the top of a line of
figures right. It will never prove at this rate.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘His mind is lost in calculations,’ said the Jack-in-a-box,
‘besides—between ourselves—he has been “cracky” for
some time. Let some one else speak, and observe that no
one is at liberty to pass a sentence on the prisoner heavier
than what he has suffered from her. I reserve <span class='it'>my</span> judgment
to the last.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I know what that will be,’ thought I; ‘oh dear! oh
dear! that a respectable maiden lady should live to be burnt
as a Guy Fawkes!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Let the prisoner drink a gallon of iced water at once,
and then be left to die of thirst.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The horrible idea that the speaker might possibly have
the power to enforce his sentence diverted my attention
from the slate, and I looked round. In front of the Jack-in-a-box
stood a tiny red flower-pot and saucer, in which was
a miniature cactus. My thoughts flew back to a bazaar in
London where, years ago, a stand of these fairy plants had
excited my warmest longings, and where a benevolent old
gentleman whom I had not seen before, and never saw
again, bought this one and gave it to me. Vague memories
of his directions for re-potting and tending it reproached me
from the past. My mind misgave me that after all it had
died a dusty death for lack of water. True, the cactus tribe
being succulent plants do not demand much moisture, but I
had reason to fear that, in this instance, the principle had
been applied too far, and that after copious baths of cold
spring water in the first days of its popularity it had eventually
perished by drought. I suppose I looked guilty, for it
nodded its prickly head towards me, and said, ‘Ah! you
know me. You remember what I was, do you? Did you
ever think of what I might have been? There was a fairy
rose which came down here not long ago—a common rose
enough, in a broken pot patched with string and white paint.
It had lived in a street where it was the only pure beautiful
thing your eyes could see. When the girl who kept it died
there were eighteen roses upon it. She was eighteen years
old, and they put the roses in the coffin with her when she
was buried. That was worth living for. Who knows what
I might have done? And what right had you to cut short a
life that might have been useful?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before I could think of a reply to these too just reproaches,
the flower-pot enlarged, the plant shot up, putting
forth new branches as it grew; then buds burst from the
prickly limbs, and in a few moments there hung about it
great drooping blossoms of lovely pink, with long white
tassels in their throats. I had been gazing at it some time
in silent and self-reproachful admiration when I became
aware that the business of this strange court was proceeding,
and that the other toys were pronouncing sentence against
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Tie a string round her neck and take her out bathing
in the brooks,’ I heard an elderly voice say in severe tones.
It was the Dowager Doll. She was inflexibly wooden, and
had been in the family for more than one generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s not fair,’ I exclaimed, ‘the string was only to keep
you from being carried away by the stream. The current is
strong, and the bank steep by the Hollow Oak Pool, and
you had no arms or legs. You were old and ugly, but you
would wash, and we loved you better than many waxen
beauties.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Old and ugly!’ shrieked the Dowager. ‘Tear her wig
off! Scrub the paint off her face! Flatten her nose on the
pavement! Saw off her legs and give her no crinoline!
Take her out bathing, I say, and bring her home in a wheel-barrow
with fern roots on the top of her.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was about to protest again, when the paint-box came
forward, and balancing itself in an artistic, undecided kind
of way on two camel’s-hair brushes which seemed to serve
it for feet, addressed the Jack-in-a-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Never dip your paint into the water. Never put your
brush into your mouth——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s not evidence,’ said the Jack-in-a-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Your notions are crude,’ said the paint-box loftily; ‘it’s
in print, and here, all of it, or words to that effect;’ with
which he touched the lid, as a gentleman might lay his hand
upon his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s not evidence,’ repeated the Jack-in-a-box. ‘Let us
proceed.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Take her to pieces and see what she’s made of, if you
please,’ tittered a pretty German toy that moved to a tinkling
musical accompaniment. ‘If her works are available
after that it will be an era in natural science.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The idea tickled me, and I laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hard-hearted wretch!’ growled the Dowager Doll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dip her in water and leave her to soak on a white soup
plate,’ said the paint-box; ‘if that doesn’t soften her feelings,
deprive me of my medal from the School of Art.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Give her a stiff neck!’ muttered the mandarin. ‘Ching
Fo! give her a stiff neck.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Knock her teeth out,’ growled the rake in a scratchy
voice; and then the tools joined in chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Take her out when its fine and leave her out when it’s
wet, and lose her in——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The coal hole,’ said the spade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The hay field,’ said the rake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The shrubbery,’ said the hoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This difference of opinion produced a quarrel, which in
turn seemed to affect the general behavior of toys, for a disturbance
arose which the Jack-in-a-box vainly endeavored to
quell. A dozen voices shouted for a dozen different punishments
and (happily for me) each toy insisted upon its own
wrongs being the first to be avenged, and no one would hear
of the claims of any one else being attended to for an instant.
Terrible sentences were passed, which I either failed to hear
through the clamor then, or have forgotten now. I have a vague
idea that several voices cried that I was to be sent to wash
in somebody’s pocket; that the work-basket wished to cram
my mouth with unfinished needlework; and that through all
the din the thick voice of my old leather ball monotonously
repeated:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Throw her into the dust-hole.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suddenly a clear voice pierced the confusion, and Rosa
tripped up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My dears,’ she began, ‘the only chance of restoring
order is to observe method. Let us follow our usual rule of
precedence. I claim the first turn as the prisoner’s oldest
toy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That you are not, Miss,’ snapped the dowager; ‘I was
in the family for fifty years.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘In the family. Yes, ma’am; but you were never her
doll in particular. I was her very own, and she kept me
longer than any other plaything. My judgment must be
first.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘She is right,’ said the Jack-in-a-box, ‘and now let us
get on. The prisoner is delivered unreservedly into the
hands of our trusty and well-beloved Rosa—doll of the first
class—for punishment according to the strict law of tit for
tat.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I shall request the assistance of the pewter tea-things,’
said Rosa, with her usual smile. ‘And now, my love,’ she
added, turning to me, ‘we will come and sit down.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where the go-cart vanished to I cannot remember, nor
how I got out of it; I only know that I suddenly found myself
free, and walking away with my hand in Rosa’s. I remember
vacantly feeling the rough edge of the stitches on
her flat kid fingers, and wondering what would come next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How very oddly you hold your feet, my dear,’ she said;
‘you stick out your toes in such an eccentric fashion, and
you lean your legs as if they were table legs, instead of supporting
yourself by my hand. Turn your heels well out,
and bring your toes together. You may even let them fold
over each other a little; it is considered to have a pretty
effect among dolls.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Under one of the big trees Miss Rosa made me sit down,
propping me against the trunk as if I should otherwise have
fallen; and in a moment more a square box of pewter tea-things
came tumbling up to our feet, where the lid burst open,
and all the tea-things fell out in perfect order; the cups on
the saucers, the lid on the teapot and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Take a little tea, my love?’ said Miss Rosa pressing a
pewter teacup to my lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made believe to drink, but was only conscious of inhaling
a draught of air with a slight flavor of tin. In taking
my second cup I was nearly choked with the teaspoon, which
got into my throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What are you doing?’ roared the Jack-in-a-box at this
moment; ‘you are not punishing her.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am treating her as she treated me,’ answered Rosa,
looking as severe as her smile would allow. ‘I believe that
tit for tat is the rule, and that at present it is my turn.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It will be mine soon,’ growled the Jack-in-a-box, and I
thought of the bonfire with a shudder. However, there was
no knowing what might happen before his turn did come, and
meanwhile I was in friendly hands. It was not the first time
my dolly and I had set together under a tree, and, truth to
say, I do not think she had any injuries to avenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘When your wig comes off,’ murmured Rosa, as she stole
a pink kid arm tenderly round my neck, ‘I’ll make you a
cap with blue and white rosettes, and pretend that you have
had a fever.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thanked her gratefully, and was glad to reflect that I
was not yet in need of an attention which I distinctly remember
having shown to her in the days of her dollhood.
Presently she jumped up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I think you shall go to bed now, dear,’ she said, and,
taking my hand once more, she led me to the big doll’s bedstead,
which, with its pretty bedclothes and white dimity
furniture, looked tempting enough to a sleeper of suitable
size. It could not have supported one-quarter of my
weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I have not made you a night-dress, my love,’ Rosa
continued; ‘I am not fond of my needle, you know. <span class='it'>You</span> were
not fond of your needle, I think. I fear you must go to
bed in your clothes, my dear.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You are very kind,’ I said, ‘but I am not tired, and—it
would not bear my weight.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Pooh! pooh!’ said Rosa. ‘My love! I remember
passing one Sunday in it with the rag-doll, and the Dowager,
and the Punch and Judy (the amount of pillow their
two noses took up I shall never forget!), and the old doll
that had nothing on, because her clothes were in the
dolls’ wash and did not get ironed on Saturday night, and
the Highlander, whose things wouldn’t come off, and who
slept in his kilt. Not bear you? Nonsense! You must
go to bed, my dear. I’ve got other things to do, and I
can’t leave you lying about.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The whole lot of you did not weigh one-quarter of
what I do,’ I cried desperately. ‘I cannot, and will not
get into that bed; I should break it all to pieces, and hurt
myself into the bargain.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, if you will not go to bed, I must put you there,’
said Rosa, and without more ado, she snatched me up in her
kid arms, and laid me down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it was just as I expected. I had hardly
touched the two little pillows (they had a meal-bag smell
from being stuffed with bran), when the woodwork gave way
with a crash, and I fell—fell—fell—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though I fully believed every bone in my body to be
broken, it was really a relief to get to the ground. As
soon as I could, I sat up, and felt myself all over. A little
stiff, but, as it seemed, unhurt. Oddly enough, I found that
I was back again under the tree; and more strange still, it
was not the tree where I sat with Rosa, but the old oak-tree
in the little wood. Was it all a dream? The toys had
vanished, the lights were out, the mosses looked dull in the
growing dusk, the evening was chilly, the hole no larger
than it was thirty years ago, and when I felt in my pocket
for my spectacles I found that they were on my nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have returned to the spot many times since, but I
never could induce a beetle to enter into conversation
on the subject, the hole remains obstinately impassable,
and I have not been able to repeat my visit to the Land of
Lost Toys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I recall my many sins against the playthings of
my childhood, I am constrained humbly to acknowledge that
perhaps this is just as well.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SAM SETS UP SHOP.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you might help me, Dot,” cried Sam in dismal
and rather injured tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the morning following the day of the earthquake,
and of Aunt Penelope’s arrival. Sam had his back to Dot,
and his face to the fire, over which indeed he had bent for
so long that he appeared to be half roasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” asked Dot, who was working at a
doll’s night-dress that had for long been partly finished, and
now seemed in a fair way to completion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the glue-pot,” Sam continued. “It does take so
long to boil. And I have been stirring at the glue with a
stick for ever so long to get it to melt. It is very hot work.
I wish you would take it for a bit. It’s as much for your
good as for mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” said Dot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes it is, Miss,” cried Sam. “You must know I’ve
got a splendid idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not another earthquake, I hope?” said Dot, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Dot, that’s truly unkind of you. I thought it
was to be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is,” said Dot, getting up. “I was only joking.
What is the idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I shall tell you till I have finished my
shop. I want to get to it now, and I wish you would take a
turn at the glue-pot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam was apt to want a change of occupation. Dot, on
the other hand, was equally averse from leaving what she
was about till it was finished, so they suited each other like
Jack Sprat and his wife. It had been an effort to Dot to
leave the night-dress which she had hoped to finish at a sitting;
but when she was fairly set to work on the glue business
she never moved till the glue was in working order,
and her face as red as a ripe tomato.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Sam had set up business in the window-seat,
and was fastening a large paper inscription over his shop.
It ran thus:—</p>

<table id='tab3' summary='' class='center'>
<colgroup>
<col span='1' style='width: 21em;'/>
</colgroup>
<tr><td class='tab3c1 tdStyle5'></td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab3c1 tdStyle5'>MR. SAM,</td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab3c1 tdStyle5'></td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab3c1 tdStyle5'><span class='it'>Doll’s Doctor and Toymender to Her Majesty,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab3c1 tdStyle5'></td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab3c1 tdStyle5'><span class='it'>the Queen, and all other Potentates.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab3c1 tdStyle5'></td></tr>
</table>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid!” shouted Dot, who was serving up the glue
as if it had been a kettle of soup, and who looked herself
very like an overtoasted cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam took the glue, and began to bustle about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Dot, get me all the broken toys, and we’ll see
what we can do. And here’s a second splendid idea. Do
you see that box? Into that we shall put all the toys that
are quite spoiled and cannot possibly be mended. It is to
be called the Hospital for Incurables. I’ve got a placard
for that. At least it’s not written yet, but here’s the paper,
and perhaps you would write it, Dot, for I am tired of writing
and I want to begin the mending.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the future,” he presently resumed, “when I
want a doll to scalp or behead, I shall apply to the Hospital
for Incurables, and the same with any other toy that I want
to destroy. And you will see, my dear Dot, that I shall be
quite a blessing to the nursery; for I shall attend the dolls
gratis, and keep all the furniture in repair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam really kept his word. He had a natural turn for
mechanical work, and, backed by Dot’s mechanical genius,
he prolonged the days of the broken toys by skillful mending,
and so acquired an interest in them which was still more
favorable to their preservation. When his birthday came
round, which was some months after these events, Dot (assisted
by Mamma and Aunt Penelope), had prepared for
him a surprise that was more than equal to any of his own
“splendid ideas.” The whole force of the toy cupboard
was assembled on the nursery table, to present Sam with a
fine box of joiner’s tools as a reward for his services, Papa
kindly acting as spokesman on the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And certain gaps in the china tea-set, some scars on the
dolls’ face, and a good many new legs, both amongst the
furniture and the animals, are now the only remaining traces
of Sam’s earthquake.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span><h1>THREE CHRISTMAS-TREES.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>This</span> is a story of Three Christmas-Trees. The first was
a real one, but the child we are to speak of did not see it.
He saw the other two, but they were not real; they only existed
in his fancy. The plot of the story is very simple;
and, as it has been described so early, it is easy for those who
think it stupid to lay the book down in good time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably every child who reads this has seen one Christmas-tree
or more; but in the small town of a distant colony
with which we have to do, this could not at one time have
been said. Christmas-trees were then by no means so universal,
even in England, as they now are, and in this little
colonial town, they were unknown. Unknown that is, till
the Governor’s wife gave her great children’s party. At
which point we will begin the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Governor had given a great many parties in his time.
He had entertained big wigs and little wigs, the passing military
and the local grandees. Everybody who had the remotest
claim to attention had been attended to: the ladies
had had their full share of balls and pleasure parties: only
one class of the population had any complaint to prefer
against his hospitality; but the class was a large one—it was
the children. However, he was a bachelor, and knew little
or nothing about little boys and girls: let us pity rather than
blame him. At last he took to himself a wife; and among
the many advantages of this important step, was a due
recognition of the claims of these young citizens. It was
towards happy Christmas-tide, that “the Governor’s amiable
and admired lady” (as she was styled in the local newspaper)
sent out notes for his first children’s party. At the
top of the note paper was a very red robin, who carried
a blue Christmas greeting in his mouth, and at the bottom—written
with the A. D. C.’s best flourish—were the magic
words, <span class='it'>A Christmas Tree</span>. In spite of the flourishes—partly
perhaps, because of them—the A. D. C.’s handwriting,
though handsome, was rather illegible. But for all this,
most of the children invited contrived to read these words,
and those who could not do so were not slow to learn the
news by hearsay. There was to be a Christmas-Tree! It
would be like a birthday party, with this above ordinary
birthdays, that there were to be presents for every one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the children invited lived in a little white house,
with a spruce fir-tree before the door. The spruce fir did
this good service to the little house, that it helped people to
find their way to it; and it was by no means easy for a
stranger to find his way to any given house in this little town,
especially if the house were small and white, and stood in
one of the back streets. For most of the houses were small,
and most of them were painted white, and the back streets
ran parallel with each other, and had no names, and were all
so much alike that it was very confusing. For instance, if
you had asked the way to Mr. So-and-So’s, it is very probable
that some friend would have directed you as follows:
“Go straight forward and take the first turning to your left,
and you will find that there are four streets, which run at
right angles to the one you are in, and parallel with each
other. Each of them has got a big pine in it—one of the
old forest trees. Take the last street but one, and the fifth
white house you come to is Mr. So-and-So’s. He has green
blinds and a colored servant.” You would not always have
got such clear directions as these, but with them you would
probably have found the house at last, partly by accident,
partly by the blinds and colored servant. Some of the
neighbors affirmed that the little white house had a name;
that all the houses and streets had names, only they were
traditional and not recorded anywhere; that very few people
knew them, and nobody made any use of them. The name
of the little white house was said to be Trafalgar Villa,
which seemed so inappropriate to the modest peaceful little
home, that the man who lived in it tried to find out why it
had been so called. He thought that his predecessor must
have been in the navy, until he found that he had been the
owner of what is called a “dry-goods store,” which seems
to mean a shop where things are sold which are not good to
eat or drink—such as drapery. At last somebody said, that
as there was a public-house called the “Duke of Wellington”
at the corner of the street, there probably had been a nearer
one called “The Nelson,” which had been burnt down, and
that the man who built “The Nelson” had built the house
with a spruce fir before it, and that so the name had arisen.
An explanation which was just so far probable, that
public-houses and fires were of frequent occurrence in those
parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this had nothing to do with the story. Only we must
say, as we said before, and as we should have said had we
been living there then, the child we speak of lived in the
little white house with one spruce fir just in front of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the children who looked forward to the Christmas-tree,
he looked forward to it the most intensely. He was an
imaginative child, of a simple, happy nature, easy to please.
His father was an Englishman, and in the long winter
evenings he would tell the child tales of the old country, to
which his mother would listen also. Perhaps the parents
enjoyed these stories the most. To the boy they were new,
and consequently delightful, but to the parents they were
old; and as regards some stories, that is better still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of a bird is this on my letter?” asked the
boy on the day which brought the Governor’s lady’s note of
invitation. “And oh! what is a Christmas-tree?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bird is an English robin,” said his father. “It is
quite another bird to that which is called a robin here: it is
smaller and rounder; and has a redder breast and bright dark
eyes, and lives and sings at home through the winter. A
Christmas-tree is a fir-tree—just such a one as that outside
the door—brought into the house and covered with lights and
presents. Picture to yourself our fir-tree lighted up with
tapers on all the branches, with dolls, and trumpets, and bonbons,
and drums, and toys of all kinds hanging from it like
fir-cones, and on the tip-top shoot a figure of a Christmas
Angel in white, with a star upon its head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy!” said the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And fancy he did. Every day he looked at the spruce
firs, and tried to imagine it laden with presents, and brilliant
with tapers, and thought how wonderful must be that “old
country”—<span class='it'>Home</span>, as it was called, even by those who had
never seen it—where the robins were so very red, and
where at Christmas the fir-trees were hung with toys instead
of cones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was certainly a pity that, two days before the party, an
original idea on the subject of snowmen struck one of the
children who used to play together, with their sleds and
snow-shoes, in the back streets. The idea was this: That
instead of having a common-place snowman, whose legs were
obliged to be mere stumps, for fear he should be top-heavy,
and who could not walk, even with them; who, in fact,
could do nothing but stand at the corner of the street, holding
his impotent stick, and staring with his pebble eyes, till
he was broken to pieces or ignominiously carried away by a
thaw,—that, instead of this, they should have a real, live
snowman, who should walk on competent legs, to the
astonishment, and (happy thought!) perhaps to the alarm of
the passers-by. This delightful novelty was to be accomplished
by covering one of the boys of the party with
snow till he looked as like a real snowman as circumstances
would admit. At first everybody wanted to be the snowman,
but, when it came to the point, it was found to be so
much duller to stand still and be covered up than to run
about and work, that no one was willing to act the part. At
last it was undertaken by the little boy from the Fir House.
He was somewhat small, but then he was so good-natured he
would always do as he was asked. So he stood manfully still,
with his arms folded over a walking-stick upon his breast,
while the others heaped the snow upon him. The plan was
not so successful as they had hoped. The snow would not
stick anywhere except on his shoulders, and when it got into
his neck he cried with the cold; but they were so anxious to
carry out their project, that they begged him to bear it “just
a little longer:” and the urchin who had devised the original
idea wiped the child’s eyes with his handkerchief, and (with
that hopefulness which is so easy over other people’s matters)
“dared say that when all the snow was on, he wouldn’t feel
it.” However, he did feel it, and that so severely that the
children were obliged to give up the game, and, taking the
stick out of his stiff little arms, to lead him home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears that it is with snowmen as with some other men
in conspicuous positions. It is easier to find fault with them
than to fill their place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The end of this was a feverish cold, and, when the day of
the party came, the ex-snowman was still in bed. It is due
to the other children to say that they felt the disappointment
as keenly as he did, and that it greatly damped the pleasure
of the party for them to think that they had prevented his
sharing in the treat. The most penitent of all was the deviser
of the original idea. He had generously offered to stay
at home with the little patient, which was as generously refused;
but the next evening he was allowed to come and sit
on the bed, and describe it all for the amusement of his
friend. He was a quaint boy, this urchin, with a face as
broad as an American Indian’s, eyes as bright as a squirrel’s,
and all the mischief in life lurking about him, till you could
see roguishness in the very folds of his hooded Indian winter
coat of blue and scarlet. In his hand he brought the sick
child’s presents: a dray with two white horses, and little
barrels that took off and on, and a driver, with wooden joints,
a cloth coat, and everything, in fact, that was suitable to the
driver of a brewer’s dray, except that he had blue boots and
earrings, and that his hair was painted in braids like a lady’s,
which is clearly the fault of the doll manufacturers, who will
persist in making them all of the weaker sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what was the Christmas-tree like?” asked the invalid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly like the fir outside your door,” was the reply.
“Just about that size, and planted in a pot covered with red
cloth. It was kept in another room till after tea, and then
when the door was opened it was like a street fire in the town
at night—such a blaze of light—candles everywhere! And
on all the branches the most beautiful presents. I got a drum
and a penwiper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there an angel?” the child asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes!” the boy answered. “It was on the tip-top
branch, and it was given to me, and I brought it for you, if
you would like it; for, you know, I am so very, very sorry I
thought of the snowman and made you ill, and I do love you,
and beg you to forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the roguish face stooped over the pillow to be kissed;
and out of a pocket in the hooded coat came forth the Christmas
Angel. In the face it bore a strong family likeness to
the drayman, but its feet were hidden in folds of snowy
muslin, and on its head glittered a tinsel star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lovely!” said the child. “Father told me about
this. I like it best of all. And it is very kind of you, for it
is not your fault that I caught cold. I should have liked it
if we could have done it, but I think to enjoy being a snowman,
one should be snow all through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had tea together, and then the invalid was tucked
up for the night. The dray was put away in the cupboard,
but he took the angel to bed with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so ended the first of the Three Christmas-Trees.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for a warm glow from the wood fire in the stove,
the room was dark; but about midnight it seemed to the
child that a sudden blaze of light filled the chamber. At
the same moment the window curtains were drawn aside,
and he saw that the spruce fir had come close up to the
panes, and was peeping in. Ah! how beautiful it looked!
It had become a Christmas-tree. Lighted tapers shone from
every familiar branch, toys of the most fascinating appearance
hung like fruit, and on the tip-top shoot there stood the
Christmas Angel. He tried to count the candles, but somehow
it was impossible. When he looked at them they
seemed to change places—to move—to become like the angel,
and then to be candles again, whilst the flames nodded
to each other and repeated the blue greeting of the robin,
“A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!” Then he
tried to distinguish the presents, but, beautiful as the toys
looked, he could not exactly discover what any of them were,
or choose which he would like best. Only the Angel he
could see clearly—so clearly! It was more beautiful than
the doll under his pillow; it had a lovely face like his own
mother’s, he thought, and on its head gleamed a star far
brighter than tinsel. Its white robes waved with the flames
of the tapers, and it stretched its arms towards him with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am to go and choose my present,” thought the child;
and he called “Mother! mother dear! please open the
window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his mother did not answer. So he thought he must
get up himself, and with an effort, he struggled out of bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he was on his feet, everything seemed changed!
Only the fire-light shone upon the walls, and the curtains
were once more firmly closed before the window. It had
been a dream, but so vivid that in his feverish state he still
thought it must be true, and dragged the curtains back to let
in the glorious sight again. The fire-light shone upon a
thick coating of frost upon the panes, but no further could he
see, so with all his strength he pushed the window open and
leaned out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spruce fir stood in its old place; but it looked very
beautiful in its Christmas dress. Beneath it lay a carpet of
pure white. The snow was clustered in exquisite shapes
upon its plumy branches; wrapping the tree top with its
little cross shots, as a white robe might wrap a figure with
outstretched arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no tapers to be seen, but northern lights shot
up into the dark blue sky, and just over the fir-tree shone
a bright, bright star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jupiter looks well to-night,” said the old Professor in
the town observatory, as he fixed his telescope; but to the
child it seemed as the star of the Christmas Angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother had really heard him call, and now came and
put him back to bed again. And so ended the second of the
Three Christmas-Trees.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was enough to have killed him, all his friends said;
but it did not. He lived to be a man, and—what is rarer—to
keep the faith, the simplicity, the tender-heartedness, the
vivid fancy of his childhood. He lived to see many Christmas-Trees
“at home,” in that old country where the robins
are red-breasts, and sing in winter. There a heart as good
and gentle as his own became one with his; and once he
brought his young wife across the sea to visit the place where
he was born. They stood near the little white house, and
he told her the story of the Christmas-trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was when I was a child,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that you are still,” said she; and she plucked a bit
of the fir-tree and kissed it, and carried it away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lived to tell the story to his children, and even to his
grandchildren; but he never was able to decide which of the
two was the more beautiful—the Christmas-Tree of his
dream, or the Spruce Fir as it stood in the loveliness of that
winter night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is told, not that it has anything to do with any of
the Three Christmas-Trees, but to show that the story is a
happy one, as is right and proper; that the hero lived, and
married, and had children, and was as prosperous as good
people, in books, should always be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course he died at last. The best and happiest of men
must die; and it is only because some stories stop short in
their history, that every hero is not duly buried before we
lay down the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When death came for our hero he was an old man. The
beloved wife, some of his children, and many of his friends
had died before him, and of those whom he had loved there
were fewer to leave than to rejoin. He had had a short illness,
with little pain, and was now lying on his death-bed in
one of the big towns in the North of England. His youngest
son, a clergyman, was with him, and one or two others
of his children, and by the fire sat the doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor had been sitting by the patient, but now that
he could do no more for him he had moved to the fire; and
they had taken the ghastly, half-emptied medicine bottles
from the table by the bedside, and had spread it with a fair
linen cloth, and had set out the silver vessels of the Supper
of the Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man had been “wandering” somewhat during
the day. He had talked much of going home to the old
country, and with the wide range of dying thoughts he had
seemed to mingle memories of childhood with his hopes of
Paradise. At intervals he was clear and collected—one of
those moments had been chosen for his last sacrament—and
he had fallen asleep with the blessing in his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slept so long and so peacefully that the son almost began
to hope there might be a change, and looked towards the
doctor, who still sat by the fire with his right leg crossed
over his left. The doctor’s eyes were also on the bed, but
at that moment he drew out his watch and looked at it with
an air of professional conviction, which said, “It’s only a
question of time.” Then he crossed his left leg over his
right, and turned to the fire again. Before the right leg
should be tired, all would be over. The son saw it as
clearly as if it had been spoken, and he too turned away and
sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they sat, the bells of a church in the town began to
chime for midnight service, for it was Christmas Eve, but
they did not wake the dying man. He slept on and on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor dozed. The son read in the Prayer Book on
the table, and one of his sisters read with him. Another,
from grief and weariness, slept with her head upon his
shoulder. Except for a warm glow from the fire, the room
was dark. Suddenly the old man sat up in bed, and, in a
strong voice, cried with inexpressible enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>How beautiful!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The son held back his sisters, and asked quietly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>What</span>, my dear father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Christmas-Tree!” he said, in a low, eager voice.
“Draw back the curtains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were drawn back; but nothing could be seen, and
still the old man gazed as if in ecstacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Light!” he murmured. “The Angel! the Star!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again there was silence; and then he stretched forth his
hands, and cried passionately,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Angel is beckoning to me! Mother! mother
dear! Please open the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sash was thrown open, and all eyes turned involuntarily
where those of the dying man were gazing. There
was no Christmas-Tree—no tree at all. But over the housetops
the morning star looked pure and pale in the dawn of
Christmas Day. For the night was past, and above the distant
hum of the streets the clear voices of some waits made
the words of an old carol heard—words dearer for their association
than their poetry—</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>When the window was opened, the soul passed; and when
they looked back to the bed the old man had lain down
again, and like a child, was smiling in his sleep—his last
sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was the Third Christmas-Tree.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span><h1>AN IDYL OF THE WOOD.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Tell</span> us a story,” said the children, “a sad one, if you
please, and a little true. But, above all, let it end badly,
for we are tired of people who live happily ever after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard one lately,” said the old man who lived in the
wood; “it is founded on fact, and it is a sad one also; but
whether it ends badly or no I cannot pretend to say. That
is a matter of taste: what is a bad ending?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A story ends badly,” said the children with authority,
“when people die, and nobody marries anybody else, especially
if it is a prince and princess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most lucid explanation,” said the old man. “I think
my story will do, for the principal character dies, and there
is no wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell it, tell it!” cried his hearers, “and tell us also
where you got it from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows the riches of a wood in summer?” said the
old man. “In summer, do I say? In spring, in autumn,
or in winter either. Who knows them? You, my children?
Well, well. Better than some of your elders, perchance.
You know the wood where I live; the hollow tree that will
hold five children, and Queen Mab knows how many fairies.
(What a castle it makes! And if it had but another floor
put into it, with a sloping ladder—like one of the round
towers of Ireland—what a house for children to live in!
With no room for lesson-books, grown-up people, or beds!)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know the way to the hazel copse, and the place
where the wild strawberries grow. You know where the
wren sits on her eggs, and, like good children, pass by with
soft steps and hushed voices, that you may not disturb that
little mother. You know (for I have shown you) where the
rare fern grows—a habitat happily yet unnoted in scientific
pages. <span class='it'>We</span> never add its lovely fronds to our nosegays, and
if we move a root it is but to plant it in another part of the
wood, with as much mystery and circumspection as if we
were performing some solemn druidical rite. It is to us as a
king in hiding, and the places of its abode we keep faithfully
secret. It will be thus held sacred by us until, with all the
seeds its untouched fronds have scattered, and all the off-shoots
we have propagated, it shall have become as plentiful
as Heaven intends all beautiful things to be. Every one is
not so scrupulous. There are certain ladies and gentlemen
who picnic near my cottage in the hot weather, and who tell
each other that they love a wood. Most of these good
people have nevertheless neither eyes nor ears for what goes
on around them, except that they hear each other, and see
the cold collation. They will picnic there summer after
summer, and not know whether they sit under oaks or ashes,
beeches or elms. All birds sing for them the same song.
Tell <span class='it'>them</span> that such a plant is rare in the neighborhood, that
there are but few specimens of it, and it will not long be
their fault if there are any. Does any one direct them to it,
they tear it ruthlessly up, and carry it away. If by any
chance a root is left, it is left so dragged and pulled and denuded
of earth, that there is small chance that it will survive.
Probably, also, the ravished clump dies in the garden or pot
to which it is transplanted, either from neglect, or from
ignorance of the conditions essential to its life; and the rare
plant becomes yet rarer. Oh! without doubt they love a
wood. It gives more shade than the largest umbrella, and is
cheaper for summer entertainment than a tent: there you
get canopy and carpet, fuel and water, shade and song, and
beauty—all gratis; and these are not small matters when
one has invited a large party of one’s acquaintance. There
are insects, it is true, which somewhat disturb our friends;
and as they do not know which sting, and which are harmless,
they kill all that come within their reach, as a safe general
principle. The town boys, too! They know the wood—that
is to say, they know where the wild fruits grow, and
how to chase the squirrel, and rob the bird’s nests, and
snare the birds. Well, well, my children; to know and
love a wood truly, it may be that one must live in it as I
have done; and then a lifetime will scarcely reveal all its
beauties, or exhaust its lessons. But even then, one must
have eyes that see, and ears that hear, or one misses a good
deal. It was in the wood that I heard this story that I shall
tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you hear it?” asked the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thrush sang it to me one night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One night?” said the children. “Then you mean a
nightingale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean a thrush,” said the old man. “Do I not know
the note of one bird from another? I tell you that pine tree
by my cottage has a legend of its own, and the topmost
branch is haunted. Must all legends be above the loves and
sorrows of our self-satisfied race alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But did you really and truly hear it?” they asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard it,” said the old man. “But, as I tell you, one
hears and one hears. I don’t say that everybody would
have heard it, merely by sleeping in my chamber; but, for
the benefit of the least imaginative, I will assure you that it
is founded on fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begin! begin!” shouted the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once upon a time,” said the old man, “there was a
young thrush, who was born in that beautiful dingle where
we last planted the —— fern. His home-nest was close to the
ground, but the lower one is, the less fear of falling; and in
woods, the elevation at which you sleep is a matter of taste,
and not of expense or gentility. He awoke to life when the
wood was dressed in the pale fresh green of early summer;
and believing, like other folk, that, his own home was at
least the principal part of the world, earth seemed to him so
happy and so beautiful an abode, that his heart felt ready to
burst with joy. The ecstacy was almost pain, till wings and
a voice came to him. Then, one day, when, after a gray
morning, the sun came out at noon, drawing the scent from
the old pine that looks in at my bedroom window, his joy
burst forth, after long silence, into song, and flying upwards
he sat on the topmost branch of the pine and sang as loud
as he could sing to the sun and the blue sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Joy! joy!’ he sang. ‘Fresh water and green woods,
ambrosial sunshine and sun-flecked shade, chattering brooks
and rustling leaves, glade, and sward, and dell. Lichens
and cool mosses, feathered ferns and flowers. Green
leaves! Green leaves! Summer! summer! summer!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was monotonous, but every word came from the
singer’s heart, which is not always the case. Thenceforward,
though he slept near the ground, he went up every day to
this pine, as to some sacred high place, and sang the same
song, of which neither he nor I were ever weary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let one be ever so inoffensive, however, one is not long
left in peace in this world, even in a wood. The thrush
sang too loudly of his simple happiness, and some boys from
the town heard him and snared him, and took him away in
a dirty cloth cap, where he was nearly smothered. The
world is certainly not exclusively composed of sunshine, and
green woods, and odorous pines. He became almost senseless
during the hot dusty walk that led to the town. It was
a seaport town, about two miles from the wood, a town of
narrow, steep streets, picturesque old houses, and odors compounded
of tar, dead fish, and many other scents less agreeable
than forest perfumes. The thrush was put into a small
wicker-cage in an upper room, in one of the narrowest and
steepest of the streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I shall die to-night,’ he piped. But he did not. He
lived that night, and for several nights and days following.
The boys took small care of him, however. He was often
left without food, without water, and always with too little
air. Two or three times they tried to sell him, but he was
not bought, for no one could hear him sing. One day he
was hung outside the window, and partly owing to the sun
and fresh air, and partly because a woman was singing in
the street, he began to carol his old song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woman was a street singer. She was even paler,
thinner, and more destitute-looking than such women usually
are. In some past time there had been beauty and feeling
in her face, but the traces of both were well-nigh gone.
An indifference almost amounting to vacancy was there now,
and, except that she sang, you might almost have fancied
her a corpse. In her voice also there had once been beauty
and feeling, and here again the traces were small indeed.
From time to time, she was stopped by fits of coughing,
when an ill-favored hunchback, who accompanied her on a
tambourine, swore and scowled at her. She sang a song of
sentiment, with a refrain about</p>

<p class='noindent'>on which the melody dwelt and quavered as if in mockery.
As she sang a sailor came down the street. His collar was
very large, his trousers were very wide, his hat hung on the
back of his head more as an ornament than for shelter; and
he had one of the roughest faces and the gentlest hearts that
ever went together since Beauty was entertained by the
Beast. His hands were in his pockets, where he could feel
one shilling and a penny, all the spare cash that remained to
him after a friendly stroll through the town. When he saw
the street singer, he stopped, pulled off his hat, and
scratched his head, as was his custom when he was puzzled
or interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s no good keeping an odd penny,’ he said to himself;
‘poor thing, she looks bad enough!’ And, bringing the
penny to the surface out of the depths of his pocket, he
gave it to the woman. The hunchback came forward to
take it, but the sailor passed him with a shove of his elbow,
and gave it to the singer, who handed it over to her companion
without moving a feature, and went on with her
song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’d like to break every bone in your ugly body,’ muttered
the sailor, with a glance at the hunchback, who
scowled in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I shall die of this close street, and of all I have suffered,’
thought the thrush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Green leaves! green leaves!’ he sang, for it was the
only song he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My voice is gone,’ thought the hunchback’s companion.
‘He’ll beat me again to-night; but it can’t last long:</p>

<p class='noindent'>she sang, for that was all the song she had learned; and it
was not her fault that it was inappropriate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the ballad singer’s captivity was nearly at an end.
When the hunchback left her that evening to spend the
sailor’s penny with the few others which she had earned, he
swore that when he came back he would make her sing
louder than she had done all day. Her face showed no
emotion, less than it did when he saw it hours after, when
beauty and feeling seemed to have returned to it in the peace
of death, when he came back and found the cage empty, and
that the long prisoned spirit had flown away to seek the face
of love and truth indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how about the thrush?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sailor had scarcely swallowed the wrath which the
hunchback had stirred in him, when his ear was caught by
the song of the thrush above him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You sing uncommon well, pretty one,’ he said, stopping
and putting his hat even farther back than usual to
look up. He was one of those good people who stop a
dozen times in one street, and look at everything as they go
along; whereby you may see three times as much of life as
other folk, but it is a terrible temptation to spend money.
It was so in this instance. The sailor looked till his kindly
eyes perceived that the bird was ill-cared for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It should have a bit of sod, it <span class='it'>should</span>,’ he said, emphatically,
taking his hat off, and scratching his head again;
‘and there’s not a crumb of food on board. Maybe, they
don’t understand the ways of birds here. It would be a
good turn to mention it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With this charitable intention he entered the house, and
when he left it, his pocket was empty, and the thrush was
carried tenderly in his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The canary died last voyage,’ he muttered apologetically
to himself, ‘and the money always does go somehow or
other.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sailor’s hands were about three times as large and
coarse as those of the boy who had carried the thrush before,
but they seemed to him three times more light and tender—they
were handy and kind, and this goes farther than taper
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thrush’s new home was not in the narrow streets.
It was in a small cottage in a small garden at the back of
the town. The canary’s old cage was comparatively roomy,
and food, water, and fresh turf were regularly supplied to
him. He could see green leaves too. There was an apple
tree in the garden, and two geraniums, a fuchsia, and a tea-rose
in the window. Near the tea-rose an old woman sat in
the sunshine. She was the sailor’s mother, and looked very
like a tidily kept window plant herself. She had a little
money of her own, which gave her a certain dignity, and
her son was very good to her; and so she dwelt in considerable
comfort, dividing her time chiefly between reading in
the big Bible, knitting socks for Jack, and raising cuttings
in bottles of water. She had heard of hothouses and forcing
frames, but she did not think much of them. She
believed a bottle of water to be the most natural, because it
was the oldest method she knew of, and she thought no good
came of new-fangled ways, and trying to outdo Nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Slow and sure is best,’ she said, and stuck to her own
system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What’s that, my dear?’ she asked, when the sailor
came in and held up the handkerchief. He told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’re always a-laying out your money on something
or other,’ said the old lady, who took the privilege of her
years to be a little testy. ‘What did you give for <span class='it'>that</span>?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A shilling, ma’am.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Tst! tst! tst!’ said the old lady, disapprovingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now, mother, don’t shake that cap of yours off your
head,’ said the sailor. ‘What’s a shilling? If I hadn’t
spent it, I should have changed it; and once change a shilling,
and it all dribbles away in coppers, and you get nothing
for it. But spend it in a lump, and you get something you
want. That’s what I say.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>I</span> want no more pets,’ said the old lady stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, you won’t be troubled with this one long,’ said
her son; ‘it’ll go with me, and that’s soon enough.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any allusion to his departure always melted the old
lady, as Jack well knew. She became tearful, and begged
him to leave the thrush with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You know, my dear, I’ve always looked to your live
things as if they were Christians; and loved them too (unless
it was that monkey that I never <span class='it'>could</span> do with!) Leave
it with me, my dear. I’d never bother myself with a bird
on board ship, if I was you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s because you’ve got a handsome son of your own,
old lady,’ chuckled the sailor; ‘I’ve neither chick nor child,
ma’am, remember, and a man must have something to look
to. The bird’ll go with me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so it came to pass that just when the thrush was
becoming domesticated, and almost happy at the cottage,
that one morning the sailor brought him fresh turf and
groundsel, besides his meal-cake, and took the cage down.
And the old woman kissed the wires, and bade the bird
good-bye, and prayed Heaven to bring him safe home again;
and they went their way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The forecastle of a steamship (even of a big one) is a
poor exchange for a snug cottage to any one but a sailor.
To Jack, the ship was home. <span class='it'>He</span> had never lived in a wood,
and carrolled in tree-tops. He preferred blue to green, and
pine masts to pine trees; and he smoked his pipe very comfortably
in the forecastle, whilst the ship rolled to and fro,
and swung the bird’s cage above his head. To the thrush it
was only an imprisonment that grew worse as time went on.
Each succeeding day made him pine more bitterly for his
native woods—the fresh air and green leaves, and the rest
and quiet, and sweet perfumes, and pleasant sounds of country
life. His turf dried up, his groundsel withered, and no
more could be got. He longed even to be back with the old
woman—to see the apple tree, and the window plants, and
be still. The shudder of the screw, the blasts of hot air
from the engine and cook’s galley, the ceaseless jangling,
clanging, pumping noises, and all the indescribable smells
which haunt a steamship, became more wearisome day by
day. Even when the cage was hung outside, the sea breeze
seemed to mock him with its freshness. The rich blue of
the waters gave him no pleasure, his eyes failed with looking
for green, the bitter, salt spray vexed him, and the wind
often chilled him to the bone, whilst the sun shone, and icebergs
gleamed upon the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sailor had been so kind a master, that the thrush
had become deeply attached to him, as birds will; and while
at the cottage he had scarcely fretted after his beloved wood.
But with every hour of the voyage, home sickness came
more strongly upon him, and his heart went back to the
nest, and the pine-top, and the old home. When one sleeps
soundly, it is seldom that one remembers one’s dreams; but
when one is apt to be roused by an unexpected lurch of the
ship, by the moan of a fog-whistle, or the scream of an
engine, one becomes a light sleeper, and the visions of the
night have a strange reality, and are easily recalled. And
now the thrush always dreamt of home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day he was hung outside. It was not a very fine
day, but he looked drooping, and the pitying sailor brought
him out, to get some air. His heart was sore with home
sickness, and he watched the sea-birds skimming up and
down with envious eyes. It seemed all very well for poor
men, who hadn’t so much as a wing to carry them over the
water, to build lumbering sea-nests, with bodies to float in
the water like fish, and wings of canvas to carry them along,
and to help it out with noisy steam-engines—and to endure
it all. But for him, who could fly over a hundred tree-tops
before a man could climb to one, it was hard to swing outside
a ship, and to watch other birds use their wings, when
his, which quivered to fly homewards, could only flutter
against the bars. As he thought, a roll of the ship threw
him forward, the wind shook the wires of the cage, and
loosened the fastening; and, when the vessel righted, the
cage-door swung slowly open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this moment, a ray of sunshine streaked the deep blue
water, and a gleaming sea-bird, which had been sitting like a
tuft of foam upon a wave, rose with outstretched pinions, and
soared away. It was too much. With one shrill pipe of
hope, the thrush fluttered from his cage, spread his wings,
and followed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the sailor found that the wind was getting up, he
came to take the cage down, and then his grief was sore indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The canary died last voyage,’ he said sadly. ‘The cage
was bought on a Friday, and I knew ill luck would come of
it. I said so to mother; but the old lady says there’s no
such thing as luck, and she’s Bible-learned, if ever a woman
was. “That’s very true,” says I, “but if I’d the money for
another cage, I wouldn’t use this;” and I never will again.
Poor bird! it was a sweet singer.’ And he turned his face
aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It may have the sense to come back,’ said one of the
crew. The sailor scratched his head, and shook it sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Noah’s bird came back to him, when she found no rest,’
he said, ‘but I don’t think mine will, Tom.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was right. The thrush returned no more. He did
not know how wide was the difference between his own
strength and that of the bird he followed. The sea-fowl cut
the air with wings of tenfold power; he swooped up and
down, he stooped to fish, he rested on the ridges of the dancing
waves, and then, with one steady flight, he disappeared,
and the thrush was left alone. Other birds passed him, and
flew about him, and fished, and rocked upon the waters near
him, but he held steadily on. Ships passed him also, but too
far away for him to rest upon; whales spouted in the distance,
and strange fowl screamed; but not a familiar object broke
the expanse of the cold sea. He did not know what course
he was taking. He hoped against hope that he was going
home. Although he was more faint and weary than he had
ever yet been, he felt no pain. The intensity of his hope to
reach the old wood made everything seem light; even at the
last, when his wings were almost powerless, he believed that
they would bear him home, and was happy. Already he
seemed to rest upon the trees, the waters sounded in his ears
like the rustling of leaves, and the familiar scent of the pine
tree seemed to him to come upon the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this he was not wrong. A country of pine woods was
near; and land was in sight, though too far away for him to
reach it now. Not home, but yet a land of wondrous summer
beauty: of woods, and flowers, and sun-flecked leaves—of
sunshine more glowing than he had ever known—of larger
ferns, and deeper mosses, and clearer skies—a land of balmy
summer nights, where the stars shine brighter than with us,
and where fireflies appear and vanish, like stars of a lower
firmament, amid the trees. As the sun broke out, the scent
of pines came strong upon the land breeze. A strange land,
but the thrush thought it was his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I smell woods,’ he chirped faintly; ‘I see the sun.
This is home!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All round him, the noisy crest of the fresh waves seemed
to carol the song he could no longer sing—‘Home, home!
fresh water and green woods, ambrosial sunshine and sun-flecked shade,
chattering brooks and rustling leaves, glade
and sward and dell, lichens and cool mosses, feathered ferns
and flowers. Green leaves! green leaves! Summer! summer!
summer!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The slackened wings dropped, the dying eyes looked
landward, and then closed. But even as he fell, he believed
himself sinking to rest on Mother Earth’s kindly bosom, and
he did not know it, when the cold waves buried him at sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then, he <span class='it'>did</span> die!” cried the children, who thought
they were tired of stories that end happily, yet, when they
heard it, liked a sad ending no better than other children do
(in which, by-the-by, we hold them to be in the right, and
can hardly forgive ourselves for chronicling this “ower true
tale”).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the old man, “he died; but it is said that the
sweet dingle which was his home—forsaken by the nightingale—is
regarded by birds as men regard a haunted house; for
that at still summer midnight, when the other thrushes sleep,
a shadowy form, more like a skeleton leaf than a living bird,
swings upon the tall tree-tops where he sat of old, and, rapt
in a happy ecstacy, sings a song more sweet and joyous than
thrush ever sang by day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard it?” asked the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man nodded. But not another word would he say.
The children, however, forthwith began to lay plans for getting
into the wood some midsummer night, to test with their
own ears the truth of his story, and to hear the spectre
thrush’s song. Whether the authorities permitted the expedition,
and if not, whether the young people baffled their
vigilance—whether they heard the song, and if so, whether
they understood it—we are not empowered to tell here.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span><h1>CHRISTMAS CRACKERS.</h1></div>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A FANTASIA.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was Christmas Eve in an old-fashioned country-house,
where Christmas was being kept with old-fashioned form and
custom. It was getting late. The candles swaggered in
their sockets, and the yule-log glowed steadily like a red-hot
coal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fire has reached his heart,” said the tutor: “he is
warm all through. How red he is! He shines with heat
and hospitality like some warm-hearted old gentleman when
a convivial evening is pretty far advanced. To-morrow he
will be as cold and grey as the morning after a festival, when
the glasses are being washed up, and the host is calculating
his expenses. Yes! you know it is so;” and the tutor
nodded to the yule-log as he spoke; and the log flared and
crackled in return, till the tutor’s face shone like his own.
He had no other means of reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tutor was grotesque-looking at any time. He was lank
and meagre, with a long body and limbs, and high shoulders.
His face was smooth-shaven, and his skin like old parchment
stretched over high cheek-bones and lantern jaws; but in their
hollow sockets his eyes gleamed with the changeful lustre of
two precious gems. In the ruddy firelight they were like
rubies, and when he drew back into the shade they glared
green like the eyes of a cat. It must not be inferred from
the tutor’s presence this evening that there were no Christmas
holidays in this house. They had begun some days before;
and if the tutor had had a home to go to, it is to be
presumed that he would have gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the candles got lower, and the log flared less often,
weird lights and shades, such as haunt the twilight, crept
about the room. The tutor’s shadow, longer, lanker, and
more grotesque than himself, mopped and mowed upon the
wall beside him. The snapdragon burnt blue, and as the
raisin-hunters stirred the flaming spirit, the ghastly light
made the tutor look so hideous that the widow’s little boy
was on the eve of howling, and spilled the raisins he had
just secured. (He did not like putting his fingers into the
flames, but he hovered near the more adventurous school-boys,
and collected the raisins that were scattered on the
table by the hasty <span class='it'>grabs</span> of braver hands.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow was a relative of the house. She had married
a Mr. Jones, and having been during his life his devoted
slave, had on his death transferred her allegiance to his son.
The late Mr. Jones was a small man with a strong temper,
a large appetite, and a taste for drawing-room theatricals.
So Mrs. Jones had called her son Macready; “for,” she
said, “his poor papa would have made a fortune on the
stage, and I wish to commemorate his talents. Besides,
Macready sounds better with Jones than a commoner Christian
name would do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his cousins called him MacGreedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The apples of the enchanted garden were guarded by
dragons. Many knights went after them. One wished for
the apples, but he did not like to fight the dragons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the tutor who spoke from the dark corner by the
fireplace. His eyes shone like a cat’s, and MacGreedy felt
like a half-scared mouse, and made up his mind to cry. He
put his right fist into one eye, and had just taken it out, and
was about to put his left fist into the other, when he saw
that the tutor was no longer looking at him. So he made
up his mind to go on with the raisins, for one can have a
peevish cry at any time, but plums are not scattered broadcast
every day. Several times he had tried to pocket them,
but just at the moment the tutor was sure to look at him,
and in his fright he dropped the raisins, and never could find
them again. So this time he resolved to eat them then and
there. He had just put one into his mouth when the tutor
leaned forward, and his eyes, glowing in the fire-light, met
MacGreedy’s, who had not even the presence of mind to
shut his mouth, but remained spellbound, with a raisin in his
cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flicker, flack! The school-boys stirred up snapdragon
again, and with the blue light upon his features the tutor
made so horrible a grimace that MacGreedy swallowed the
raisin with a start. He had bolted it whole, and it might
have been a bread pill for any enjoyment he had of the
flavor. But the tutor laughed aloud. He certainly was an
alarming object, pulling those grimaces in the blue brandy
glare; and unpleasantly like a picture of Bogy himself with
horns and a tail, in a juvenile volume upstairs. True, there
were no horns to speak of among the tutor’s grizzled curls,
and his coat seemed to fit as well as most people’s on his long
back, so that unless he put his tail in his pocket, it is difficult
to see how he could have had one. But then (as Miss
Letitia said) “With dress one can do anything and hide anything.”
And on dress Miss Letitia’s opinion was final.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Letitia was a cousin. She was dark, high-colored,
glossy-haired, stout, and showy. She was as neat as a new
pin, and had a will of her own. Her hair was firmly fixed
by bandoline, her garibaldis by an arrangement which failed
when applied to those of the widow, and her opinions by the
simple process of looking at everything from one point of
view. Her <span class='it'>forte</span> was dress and general ornamentation; not
that Miss Letitia was extravagant—far from it. If one may
use the expression, she utilized for ornament a hundred bits
and scraps that most people would have wasted. But, like
other artists, she saw everything through the medium of her
own art. She looked at birds with an eye to hats, and at
flowers with reference to evening parties. At picture exhibitions
and concerts she carried away jacket patterns and
bonnets in her head, as other people make mental notes of
an aerial effect, or a bit of fine instrumentation. An enthusiastic
horticulturist once sent Miss Letitia a cut specimen
of a new flower. It was a lovely spray from a lately-imported
shrub. A botanist would have pressed it—an artist
must have taken its portrait—a poet might have written
a sonnet in praise of its beauty. Miss Letitia twisted a
piece of wire round its stem, and fastened it on to her black
lace bonnet. It came on the day of a review, when Miss
Letitia had to appear in a carriage, and it was quite a success.
As she said to the widow, “It was so natural that no
one could doubt its being Parisian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a strange fellow that tutor is!” said the visitor.
He spoke to the daughter of the house, a girl with a face
like a summer’s day, and hair like a ripe corn-field rippling
in the sun. He was a fine young man, and had a youth’s
taste for the sports and amusements of his age. But lately
he had changed. He seemed to himself to be living in a
higher, nobler atmosphere than hitherto. He had discovered
that he was poetical—he might prove to be a genius. He
certainly was eloquent, he could talk for hours and did so—to
the young lady with the sunshiny face. They spoke on
the highest subjects, and what a listener she was! So intelligent
and appreciative, and with such an exquisite <span class='it'>pose</span> of
the head—it must inspire a block of wood merely to see
such a creature in a listening attitude. As to our young
friend, he poured forth volumes; he was really clever, and
for her he became eloquent. To-night he spoke of Christmas,
of time-honored custom and old association; and what
he said would have made a Christmas article for a magazine
of the first class. He poured scorn on the cold nature that
could not, and the affectation that would not, appreciate the
domestic festivities of this sacred season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What, he asked, could be more delightful, more perfect,
than such a gathering as this, of the family circle round the
Christmas hearth? He spoke with feeling, and it may be
said with disinterested feeling, for he had not joined his
family circle himself this Christmas, and there was a vacant
place by the hearth of his own home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is strange,” said the young lady (she spoke of the
tutor in answer to the above remark); “but I am very fond
of him. He has been with us so long he is like one of the
family; though we know as little of his history as we did on
the day he came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looks clever,” said the visitor. (Perhaps that is the
least one can say for a fellow-creature who shows a great
deal of bare skull, and is not otherwise good-looking.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is clever,” she answered, “wonderfully clever; so
clever and so odd that sometimes I fancy he is hardly
‘canny.’ There is something almost supernatural about his
acuteness and his ingenuity, but they are so kindly used; I
wonder he has not brought out any playthings for us to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Playthings?” inquired the young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; on birthdays or festivals like this he generally
brings something out of those huge pockets of his. He has
been all over the world, and he produces Indian puzzles,
Japanese flower-buds that bloom in hot water, and German
toys with complicated machinery, which I suspect him of manufacturing
himself. I call him God-papa Drosselmayer,
after that delightful old fellow in Hoffman’s tale of the Nut
Cracker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that about crackers?” inquired the tutor,
sharply, his eyes changing color like a fire opal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am talking of <span class='it'>Nussknacker und Mausekönig</span>,” laughed
the young lady. “Crackers do not belong to Christmas;
fireworks come on the fifth of November.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut, tut!” said the tutor; “I always tell your ladyship
that you are still a tom-boy at heart, as when I first came, and
you climbed trees and pelted myself and my young students
with horse-chestnuts. You think of crackers to explode at
the heels of timorous old gentlemen in a November fog;
but I mean bonbon crackers, colored crackers, dainty
crackers—crackers for young people with mottoes of sentiment”—(here
the tutor shrugged his high shoulders an inch
or two higher, and turned the palms of his hands outwards
with a glance indescribably comical)—“crackers with paper
prodigies, crackers with sweetmeats—<span class='it'>such</span> sweetmeats!”
He smacked his lips with a grotesque contortion, and looked
at Master MacGreedy, who choked himself with his last
raisin, and forthwith burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow tried in vain to soothe him with caresses, he
only stamped and howled the more. But Miss Letitia gave
him some smart smacks on the shoulders to cure his choking
fit, and as she kept up the treatment with vigor the young
gentleman was obliged to stop and assure her that the raisin
had “gone the right way” at last. “If he were my child,”
Miss Letitia had been known to observe, with that confidence
which characterises the theories of those who are not parents,
“I would &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.;” in fact, Miss Letitia thought
she would have made a different boy of him—as, indeed, I
believe she would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are crackers all that you have for us, sir?” asked one
of the two school-boys, as they hung over the tutor’s chair.
They were twins, grand boys, with broad, good-humored
faces, and curly wigs, as like as two puppy dogs of the same
breed. They were only known apart by their intimate
friends, and were always together, romping, laughing, snarling,
squabbling, huffing and helping each other against the
world. Each of them owned a wiry terrier, and in their relations
to each other the two dogs (who were marvellously
alike) closely followed the example of their masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not care for crackers, Jim?” asked the tutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much, sir. They do for girls: but, as you know, I
care for nothing but military matters. Do you remember
that beautiful toy of yours—‘The Besieged City?’ Ah! I
liked that. Look out, Tom! you’re shoving my arm. Can’t
you stand straight, man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“R-r-r-r—r-r, snap!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom’s dog was resenting contact with Jim’s dog on the
hearthrug. There was a hustle among the four, and then
they subsided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Besieged City was all very well for you, Jim,” said
Tom, who meant to be a sailor; “but please to remember
that it admitted of no attack from the sea; and what was
there for me to do? Ah, sir! you are so clever, I often
think you could help me to make a swing with ladders instead
of single ropes, so that I could run up and down the
rigging whilst it was in full go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be something like your fir-tree prank, Tom,”
said his sister. “Can you believe,” she added, turning to
the visitor, “that Tom lopped the branches of a tall young
fir-tree all the way up, leaving little bits for foothold, and
then climbed up it one day in an awful storm of wind, and
clung on at the top, rocking backwards and forwards? And
when papa sent word for him to come down, he said parental
authority was superseded at sea by the rules of the service.
It was a dreadful storm, and the tree snapped very
soon after he got safe to the ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm!” sneered Tom, “a capful of wind. Well, it
did blow half a gale at the last. But oh! it was glorious!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us see what we can make of the crackers,” said the
tutor—and he pulled some out of his pocket. They were
put in a dish upon the table, for the company to choose
from; and the terriers jumped and snapped, and tumbled
over each other, for they thought that the plate contained
eatables. Animated by the same idea, but with quieter
steps, Master MacGreedy also approached the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dogs are noisy,” said the tutor, “too noisy. We
must have quiet—peace and quiet.” His lean hand was
once more in his pocket, and he pulled out a box, from
which he took some powder, which he scattered on the burning
log. A slight smoke now rose from the hot embers, and
floated into the room. Was the powder one of those strange
compounds that act upon the brain? Was it a magician’s
powder? Who knows? With it came a sweet, subtile fragrance.
It is strange—every one fancied he had smelt it
before, and all were absorbed in wondering what it was, and
where they had met with it. Even the dogs sat on their
haunches with their noses up, sniffing in a speculative manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not lavender,” said the grandmother slowly, “and
it’s not rosemary. There is a something of tansy in it (and a
very fine tonic flavor too, my dears, though it’s <span class='it'>not</span> in fashion
now). Depend upon it, it’s a potpourri, and from an excellent
receipt, sir”—and the old lady bowed courteously
towards the tutor. “My mother made the best potpourri in
the county, and it was very much like this. Not quite,
perhaps, but much the same, much the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grandmother was a fine old gentlewoman “of the old
school,” as the phrase is. She was very stately and
gracious in her manners, daintily neat in her person, and much
attached to the old parson of the parish, who now sat near
her chair. All her life she had been very proud of her fine
stock of fair linen, both household and personal; and for
many years past had kept her own grave-clothes ready in a
drawer. They were bleached as white as snow, and lay
amongst bags of dry lavender and potpourri. Many times
had it seemed likely that they would be needed, for the old
lady had had severe illnesses of late, when the good parson sat
by her bedside, and read to her of the coming of the Bridegroom,
and of that “fine linen, clean and white,” which is
“the righteousness of the saints.” It was of that drawer,
with its lavender and potpourri bags, that the scented smoke
had reminded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has rather an overpowering odor,” said the old parson,
“it is suggestive of incense. I am sure I once smelt something
like it in the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem. It
is very delicious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parson’s long residence in his parish had been marked
by one great holiday. With the savings of many years he
had performed a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; and it was
rather a joke against him that he illustrated a large variety
of subjects by the reference to his favorite topic, the holiday
of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It smells of gunpowder,” said Jim, decidedly, “and
something else. I can’t tell what.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something one smells in a seaport town,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t be very delicious then,” Jim retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not <span class='it'>quite</span> the same,” piped the widow; “but it
reminds me very much of an old bottle of attar of roses that
was given to me when I was at school, with a copy of
verses, by a young gentleman who was brother to one of the
pupils. I remember Mr. Jones was quite annoyed when he
found it in an old box, where I am sure I had not touched it
for ten years or more; and I never spoke to him but once,
on Examination Day (the young gentleman, I mean). And
it’s like—yes, it’s certainly like a hair-wash Mr. Jones used
to use. I’ve forgotten what it was called, but I know it cost
fifteen shillings a bottle; and Macready threw one over a
few weeks before his dear papa’s death, and annoyed him
extremely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst the company were thus engaged, Master MacGreedy
took advantage of the general abstraction to secure
half a dozen crackers to his own share; he retired to a
corner with them, where he meant to pick them quietly to
pieces by himself. He wanted the gay paper, and the
motto, and the sweetmeats; but he did not like the report of
the cracker. And then what he did want, he wanted all to
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give us a cracker,” said Master Jim, dreamily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dogs, after a few dissatisfied snorts, had dropped from
their sitting posture, and were lying close together on the
rug, dreaming, and uttering short commenting barks and
whines at intervals. The twins were now reposing lazily at
the tutor’s feet, and did not feel disposed to exert themselves
even so far as to fetch their own bonbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one,” said the tutor, taking a fresh cracker from
his pocket. One end of it was of red and gold paper, the
other of transparent green stuff with silver lines. The boys
pulled it.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report was louder than Jim had expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The firing has begun,” he murmured, involuntarily;
“steady, steady!” these last words were to his horse, who
seemed to be moving under him, not from fear, but from impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had been the red and gold paper of the cracker was
now the scarlet and gold lace of his own cavalry uniform.
He knocked a speck from his sleeve, and scanned the distant
ridge, from which a thin line of smoke floated solemnly
away, with keen, impatient eyes. Were they to stand inactive
all the day?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the horse erects his head. His eyes sparkle—he
pricks his sensitive ears—his nostrils quiver with a strange
delight. It is the trumpet! Fan farrâ! Fan farrâ! The
brazen voice speaks—the horses move—the plumes wave—the
helmets shine. On a summer’s day they ride slowly,
gracefully, calmly down a slope, to Death or Glory. Fan
farrâ! Fan farrâ! Fan farrâ!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all this Master Tom knew nothing. The report of the
cracker seemed to him only an echo in his brain of a sound
that had been in his ears for thirty-six weary hours. The
noise of a heavy sea beating against the ship’s side in a gale.
It was over now, and he was keeping the midnight watch on
deck, gazing upon the liquid green of the waves, which heaving
and seething after storm, were lit with phosphoric light,
and as the ship held steadily on her course, poured past at
the rate of twelve knots an hour in a silvery stream. Faster
than any ship can sail his thoughts travelled home, and as
old times came back to him, he hardly knew whether what
he looked at was the phosphor-lighted sea, or green gelatine
paper barred with silver. And did the tutor speak? Or
was it the voice of some sea monster sounding in his ears?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spirits of the storm have gone below to make their
report. The treasure gained from sunk vessels has been
reckoned, and the sea is illuminated in honor of the spoil.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitor now took a cracker and held it to the young
lady. Her end was of white paper with a raised pattern;
his of dark-blue gelatine with gold stars. It snapped, the
bonbon dropped between them, and the young man got the
motto. It was a very bald one—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“My heart is thine.</p>
<p class='line0'>Wilt thou be mine?”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>He was ashamed to show it to her. What could be more
meagre? One could write a hundred better couplets “standing
on one leg,” as the saying is. He was trying to improvise
just one for the occasion, when he became aware that
the blue sky over his head was dark with the shades of
night, and lighted with stars. A brook rippled near with a
soothing monotony. The evening wind sighed through the
trees, and wafted the fragrance of the sweet bay-leaved
willow towards him, and blew a stray lock of hair against
his face. Yes! <span class='it'>She</span> also was there, walking beside him,
under the scented willow bushes. Where, why, and whither
he did not ask to know. She was with him—with him; and
he seemed to tread on the summer air. He had no doubt as
to the nature of his own feelings for her, and here was such
an opportunity for declaring them as might never occur
again. Surely now, if ever, he would be eloquent! Thoughts
of poetry clothed in words of fire must spring unbidden to his
lips at such a moment. And yet somehow he could not find
a single word to say. He beat his brains, but not an idea
would come forth. Only that idiotic cracker motto, which
haunted him with its meagre couplet.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“My heart is thine,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wilt thou be mine?”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Meanwhile they wandered on. The precious time was passing.
He must at least make a beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a fine night it is!” he observed. But, oh dear!
That was a thousand times balder and more meagre than the
cracker motto; and not another word could he find to say.
At this moment the awkward silence was broken by a voice
from a neighboring copse. It was a nightingale singing to
his mate. There was no lack of eloquence, and of melodious
eloquence, there. The song was as plaintive as old
memories, and as full of tenderness as the eyes of the young
girl were full of tears. They were standing still now, and
with her graceful head bent she was listening to the bird.
He stooped his head near hers, and spoke with a simple
natural outburst almost involuntary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you ever think of old times? Do you remember the
old house, and the fun we used to have? and the tutor whom
you pelted with horse-chestnuts when you were a little
girl? And those cracker bonbons, and the motto <span class='it'>we</span> drew—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>‘My heart is thine.</p>
<p class='line0'>Wilt thou be mine?’ ”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>She smiled, and lifted her eyes (“blue as the sky, and bright
as the stars,” he thought) to his, and answered “Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the bonbon motto was avenged, and there was
silence. Eloquent, perfect, complete, beautiful silence!
Only the wind sighed through the fragrant willows, the
stream rippled, the stars shone and in the neighboring copse
the nightingale sang, and sang, and sang.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the white end of the cracker came into the young
lady’s hand, she was full of admiration for the fine raised
pattern. As she held it between her fingers it suddenly
struck her that she had discovered what the tutor’s fragrant
smoke smelt like. It was like the scent of orange-flowers,
and had certainly a soporific effect upon the senses. She felt
very sleepy, and as she stroked the shiny surface of the
cracker she found herself thinking it was very soft for
paper, and then rousing herself with a start, and wondering
at her own folly in speaking thus of the white silk in which
she was dressed, and of which she was holding up the skirt
between her finger and thumb, as if she were dancing a
minuet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s grandmamma’s egg-shell brocade!” she cried. “Oh,
Grandmamma! Have you given it to me? That lovely old
thing! But I thought it was the family wedding-dress, and
that I was not to have it till I was a bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you are, my dear. And a fairer bride the sun
never shone on,” sobbed the old lady, who was kissing and blessing
her, and wishing her, in the words of the old formula—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Health to wear it,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Strength to tear it,</p>
<p class='line0'>And money to buy another.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“There is no hope for the last two things, you know,” said
the young girl; “for I am sure that the flag that braved a
thousand years was not half so strong as your brocade; and
as to buying another, there are none to be bought in these
degenerate days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady’s reply was probably very gracious, for she
liked to be complimented on the virtues of old things in
general, and of her egg-shell brocade in particular. But of
what she said her granddaughter heard nothing. With the
strange irregularity of dreams, she found herself, she knew
not how, in the old church. It was true. She was a bride,
standing there with old friends and old associations thick
around her, on the threshold of a new life. The sun shone
through the stained glass of the windows, and illuminated
the brocade, whose old-fashioned stiffness so became her
childish beauty, and flung a thousand new tints over her
sunny hair, and drew so powerful a fragrance from the
orange blossom with which it was twined, that it was almost
overpowering. Yes! It was too sweet—too strong. She
certainly would not be able to bear it much longer without
losing her senses. And the service was going on. A
question had been asked of her, and she must reply. She
made a strong effort, and said “Yes,” simply and very
earnestly, for it was what she meant. But she had no sooner
said it than she became uneasily conscious that she had not
used the right word. Some one laughed. It was the tutor,
and his voice jarred and disturbed the dream, as a stone
troubles the surface of still water. The vision trembled, and
then broke, and the young lady found herself still sitting
by the table and fingering the cracker paper, whilst the tutor
chuckled and rubbed his hands by the fire, and his shadow
scrambled on the wall like an ape upon a tree. But her
“Yes” had passed into the young man’s dream without disturbing
it, and he dreamt on.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a cracker like the preceding one that the grandmother
and the parson pulled together. The old lady had
insisted upon it. The good rector had shown a tendency to
low spirits this evening, and a wish to withdraw early. But
the old lady did not approve of people “shirking” (as boys
say) either their duties or their pleasures; and to keep a
“merry Christmas” in a family circle that has been spared
to meet in health and happiness, seemed to her to be both
the one and the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his sermon for next day which weighed on the
parson’s mind. Not that he was behindhand with that part
of his duties. He was far too methodical in his habits for
that, and it had been written before the bustle of Christmas
week began. But after preaching Christmas sermons from
the same pulpit for thirty-five years, he felt keenly how difficult
it is to awaken due interest in subjects that are so
familiar, and to give due force to lessons so often repeated.
So he wanted a quiet hour in his own study before he went
to rest, with the sermon that did not satisfy him, and the
subject that should be so heart-stirring and ever new—the
Story of Bethlehem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He consented, however, to pull one cracker with the
grandmother, though he feared the noise might startle her
nerves, and said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nerves were not invented in my young days,” said the
old lady, firmly; and she took her part in the ensuing explosion
without so much as a wink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the crackers snapped, it seemed to the parson as if the
fragrant smoke from the yule-log were growing denser in the
room. Through the mist from time to time the face of the
tutor loomed large, and then disappeared. At last the clouds
rolled away, and the parson breathed clear air. Clear, yes,
and how clear! This brilliant freshness, these intense lights
and shadows, this mildness and purity in the night air——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not England,” he muttered, “it is the East. I
have felt no air like this since I breathed the air of Palestine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over his head, through immeasurable distances, the dark-blue
space was lighted by the great multitude of the stars,
whose glittering ranks have in that atmosphere a distinctness
and a glory unseen with us. Perhaps no scene of beauty in
the visible creation has proved a more hackneyed theme for
the poet and the philosopher than a starry night. But not
all the superabundance of simile and moral illustration with
which the subject has been loaded can rob the beholder of
the freshness of its grandeur or the force of its teaching; that
noblest and most majestic vision of the handiwork of God on
which the eye of man is here permitted to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the parson gazed he became conscious that he was not
alone. Other eyes beside his were watching the skies to-night.
Dark, profound, patient, eastern eyes, used from the
cradle to the grave to watch and wait. The eyes of star-gazers
and dream-interpreters; men who believed the fate
of empires to be written in shining characters on the face of
heaven, as the “Mene, Mene,” was written in fire on the
walls of the Babylonian palace. The old parson was one of
the many men of real learning and wide reading who pursue
their studies in the quiet country parishes of England, and
it was with the keen interest of intelligence that he watched
the group of figures that lay near him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this a vision of the past?” he asked himself. “There
can be no doubt as to these men. They are star-gazers,
magi, and, from their dress and bearing, men of high rank;
perhaps ‘teachers of a higher wisdom’ in one of the purest
philosophies of the old heathen world. When one thinks,”
he pursued, “of the intense interest, the eager excitement
which the student of history finds in the narrative of the
past as unfolded in dusty records written by the hand of
man, one may realize how absorbing must have been that
science which professed to unveil the future, and to display
to the eyes of the wise the fate of dynasties written with the
finger of God amid the stars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark-robed figures were so still that they might
almost have been carved in stone. The air seemed to grow
purer and purer; the stars shone brighter and brighter; suspended
in ether the planets seemed to hang like lamps.
Now a shooting meteor passed athwart the sky, and vanished
behind the hill. But not for this did the watchers
move; in silence they watched on—till, on a sudden, how
and whence the parson knew not, across the shining ranks
of that immeasurable host, whose names and number are
known to God alone, there passed in slow but obvious motion
one brilliant solitary star—a star of such surpassing
brightness that he involuntarily joined in the wild cry of joy
and greeting with which the Men of the East now prostrated
themselves with their faces to the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not understand the language in which, with
noisy clamor and gesticulation, they broke their former profound
and patient silence, and greeted the portent for which
they had watched. But he knew now that these were the
Wise Men of the Epiphany, and that this was the Star of
Bethlehem. In his ears rang the energetic simplicity of the
Gospel narrative, “When they saw the Star, they rejoiced
with exceeding great joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With exceeding great joy! Ah! happy magi, who (more
blest than Balaam the son of Beor), were faithful to the dim
light vouchsafed to you; the Gentile church may well be
proud of your memory. Ye travelled long and far to bring
royal offerings to the King of the Jews, with a faith not
found in Israel. Ye saw him whom prophets and kings had
desired to see, and were glad. Wise men indeed, and wise
with the highest wisdom, in that ye suffered yourselves to be
taught of God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the parson prayed that if this were indeed a dream
he might dream on; might pass, if only in a vision, over the
hill, following the footsteps of the magi, whilst the Star
went before them, till he should see it rest above that city,
which, little indeed among the thousands of Judah, was yet
the birthplace of the Lord’s Christ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” he almost sobbed, “let me follow! On my knees
let me follow into the house and see the Holy Child. In the
eyes of how many babies I have seen mind and thought far
beyond their powers of communication, every mother knows.
But if at times, with a sort of awe, one sees the immortal
soul shining through the prison-bars of helpless infancy,
what, oh! what must it be to behold the Godhead veiled in
flesh through the face of a little child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parson stretched out his arms, but even with the
passion of his words the vision began to break. He dared
not move for fear it should utterly fade, and as he lay still and
silent, the wise men roused their followers, and led by the
Star, the train passed solemnly over the distant hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the clear night became clouded with fragrant vapor,
and with a sigh the parson awoke.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the cracker snapped and the white end was left in
the grandmother’s hand, she was astonished to perceive (as
she thought) that the white lace veil which she had worn
over her wedding bonnet was still in her possession, and that
she was turning it over in her fingers. “I fancied I gave it
to Jemima when her first baby was born,” she muttered
dreamily. It was darned and yellow, but it carried her back
all the same, and recalled happy hours with wonderful
vividness. She remembered the post-chaise and the postillion.
“He was such a pert little fellow, and how we laughed
at him! He must be either dead or a very shaky old man
by now,” said the old lady. She seemed to smell the scent
of meadow-sweet that was so powerful in a lane through
which they drove; and how clearly she could see the clean
little country inn where they spent the honeymoon! She
seemed to be there now, taking off her bonnet and shawl, in
the quaint clean chamber, with the heavy oak rafters, and
the jasmine coming in at the window, and glancing with pardonable
pride at the fair face reflected in the mirror. But
as she laid her things on the patchwork coverlet, it seemed
to her that the lace veil became fine white linen, and was
folded about a figure that lay in the bed; and when she
looked round the room again everything was draped in white—white
blinds hung before the windows, and even the
old oak chest and the press were covered with clean white
cloths, after the decent custom of the country; whilst from
the church tower without the passing bell tolled slowly.
She had not seen the face of the corpse, and a strange
anxiety came over her to count the strokes of the bell, which
tell if it is a man, woman, or child who has passed away.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven! No more. It was
a woman, and when she looked on the face of the dead she
saw her own. But even as she looked the fair linen of the
grave clothes became the buoyant drapery of another figure,
in whose face she found a strange recognition of
the lineaments of the dead, with all the loveliness
of the bride. But ah! more, much more! On that
face there was a beauty not doomed to wither, before those
happy eyes lay a future unshadowed by the imperfections of
earthly prospects, and the folds of that robe were white as no
fuller on earth can white them. The window curtain
parted, the jasmine flowers bowed their heads, the spirit
passed from the chamber of death, and the old lady’s dream
was ended.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Letitia had shared a cracker with the widow. The
widow squeaked when the cracker went off, and then insisted
upon giving up the smart paper and everything to Miss
Letitia. She had always given up everything to Mr. Jones,
she did so now to Master MacGreedy, and was quite unaccustomed
to keep anything for her own share. She did
not give this explanation herself, but so it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cracker that thus fell into the hands of Miss Letitia
was one of those new-fashioned ones that have a paper pattern
of some article of dress wrapped up in them instead of
a bonbon. This one was a paper bonnet made in the latest
<span class='it'>mode</span>—of green tissue paper; and Miss Letitia stuck it on
the top of her chignon with an air that the widow envied
from the bottom of her heart. She had not the gift of
“carrying off” her clothes. But to the tutor, on the
contrary, it seemed to afford the most extreme amusement;
and as Miss Letitia bowed gracefully hither and thither in the
energy of her conversation with the widow, the green paper
fluttering with each emphasis, he fairly shook with delight,
his shadow dancing like a maniac beside him. He had scattered
some more powder on the coals, and it may have been
that the smoke got into her eyes, and confused her ideas of
color, but Miss Letitia was struck with a fervid and otherwise
unaccountable admiration for the paper ends of the
cracker, which were most unusually ugly. One was of a
sallowish salmon-color, and transparent, the other was of
brick-red paper with a fringe. As Miss Letitia turned them
over, she saw, to her unspeakable delight, that there were
several yards of each material, and her peculiar genius instantly
seized upon the fact that in the present rage for
double skirts there might be enough of the two kinds to
combine into a fashionable dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had never struck her before that a dirty salmon went
well with brick red. “They blend so becomingly, my dear,”
she murmured; “and I think the under skirt will sit well, it
is so stiff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow did not reply. The fumes of the tutor’s compound
made her sleepy, and though she nodded to Miss
Letitia’s observations, it was less from appreciation of their
force, than from inability to hold up her head. She was
dreaming uneasy, horrible dreams, like nightmares; in which
from time to time there mingled expressions of doubt and
dissatisfaction which fell from Miss Letitia’s lips. “Just
half a yard short—no gores—false hem” (and the melancholy
reflection that) “flounces take so much stuff.” Then
the tutor’s face kept appearing and vanishing with horrible
grimaces through the mist. At last the widow fell fairly
asleep, and dreamed that she was married to the Blue Beard
of nursery annals, and that on his return from his memorable
journey he had caught her in the act of displaying the
mysterious cupboard to Miss Letitia. As he waved his
scimitar over her head, he seemed unaccountably to assume
the form and features of the tutor. In her agitation the
poor woman could think of no plea against his severity,
except that the cupboard was already crammed with the
corpses of his previous wives, and that there was no room
for her. She was pleading this argument when Miss
Letitia’s voice broke in upon her dream with decisive
accent:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s enough for two bodies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow shrieked and awoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“High and low,” explained Miss Letitia. “My dear,
what <span class='it'>are</span> you screaming about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sorry indeed,” said the widow; “I beg your
pardon, I am sure, a thousand times. But since Mr. Jones’s
death I have been so nervous, and I had such a horrible
dream. And, oh dear! oh dear!” she added, “what is the
matter with my precious child? Macready, love, come to
your mamma, my pretty lamb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ugh! ugh! There were groans from the corner where
Master MacGreedy sat on his crackers as if they were eggs,
and he hatching them. He had only touched one, as yet,
of the stock he had secured. He had picked it to pieces,
had avoided the snap, and had found a large comfit like an
egg with a rough shell inside. Every one knows that the
goodies in crackers are not of a very superior quality.
There is a large amount of white lead in the outside thinly
disguised by a shabby flavor of sugar. But that outside
once disposed of, there lies an almond at the core. Now an
almond is a very delicious thing in itself, and doubly nice
when it takes the taste of white paint and chalk out of one’s
mouth. But in spite of all the white lead and sugar and chalk
through which he had sucked his way, MacGreedy could not
come to the almond. A dozen times had he been on the
point of spitting out the delusive sweetmeat; but just as he
thought of it he was sure to feel a bit of hard rough edge,
and thinking he had gained the kernel at last, he held
valiantly on. It only proved to be a rough bit of sugar,
however, and still the interminable coating melted copiously
in his mouth; and still the clean, fragrant almond evaded
his hopes. At last with a groan he spat the seemingly undiminished
bonbon on to the floor, and turned as white and
trembling as an arrow-root blancmange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In obedience to the widow’s entreaties the tutor opened a
window, and tried to carry MacGreedy to the air; but that
young gentleman utterly refused to allow the tutor to approach
him, and was borne howling to bed by his mamma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the fresh air the fumes of the fragrant smoke dispersed,
and the company roused themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather oppressive, eh?” said the master of the house,
who had had his dream too, with which we have no concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dogs had had theirs also, and had testified to the
same in their sleep by low growls and whines. Now they
shook themselves, and rubbed against each other, growling
in a warlike manner through their teeth, and wagging peaceably
with their little stumpy tails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins shook themselves, and fell to squabbling as to
whether they had been to sleep or no; and, if either, which
of them had given way to that weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Letitia took the paper bonnet from her head with a
nervous laugh, and after looking regretfully at the cracker
papers put them in her pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parson went home through the frosty night. In the
village street he heard a boy’s voice singing two lines of the
Christmas hymn—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Trace we the Babe Who hath redeemed our loss</p>
<p class='line0'>From the poor Manger to the bitter Cross;”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and his eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady went to bed and slept in peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In all the thirty-five years we have been privileged to
hear you, sir,” she told the rector next day after service, “I
never heard such a Christmas sermon before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitor carefully preserved the blue paper and the
cracker motto. He came down early next morning to find
the white half to put with them. He did not find it, for the
young lady had taken it the night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tutor had been in the room before him, wandering
round the scene of the evening’s festivities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yule-log lay black and cold upon the hearth, and the
tutor nodded to it. “I told you how it would be,” he said;
“but never mind, you have had your day, and a merry one
too.” In the corner lay the heap of crackers which Master
MacGreedy had been too ill to remember when he retired.
The tutor pocketed them with a grim smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the comfit, it was eaten by one of the dogs, who had
come down earliest of all. He swallowed it whole, so
whether it contained an almond or not, remains a mystery
to the present time.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span><h1>AMELIA AND THE DWARFS.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My</span> godmother’s grandmother knew a good deal about the
fairies. <span class='it'>Her</span> grandmother had seen a fairy rade on a Rodmas
Eve, and she herself could remember a copper vessel of
a queer shape which had been left by the elves on some occasion
at an old farm-house among the hills. The following
story came from her, and where she got it I do not know.
She used to say it was a pleasant tale, with a good moral in
the inside of it. My godmother often observed that a tale
without a moral was like a nut without a kernel, not worth
the cracking. (We called fireside stories “cracks” in our
part of the country.) This is the tale.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AMELIA.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A couple of gentlefolk once lived in a certain part of
England. (My godmother never would tell the name either
of the place or the people, even if she knew it. She said
one ought not to expose one’s neighbors’ failings more than
there was a due occasion for.) They had an only child, a
daughter, whose name was Amelia. They were an easy-going,
good-humored couple; “rather soft,” my godmother
said, but she was apt to think anybody “soft” who came
from the southern shires, as these people did. Amelia, who
had been born farther north, was by no means so. She had
a strong, resolute will, and a clever head of her own,
though she was but a child. She had a way of her own too,
and had it very completely. Perhaps because she was an
only child, or perhaps because they were so easy going, her
parents spoiled her. She was, beyond question, the most
tiresome little girl in that or any other neighborhood.
From her baby days her father and mother had taken every
opportunity of showing her to their friends, and there was
not a friend who did not dread the infliction. When the
good lady visited her acquaintances, she always took Amelia
with her, and if the acquaintances were fortunate enough
to see from the windows who was coming, they used to
snatch up any delicate knick-knacks, or brittle ornaments lying
about, and put them away, crying, “What is to be done?
Here comes Amelia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Amelia came in, she would stand and survey the room,
whilst her mother saluted her acquaintances; and if anything
struck her fancy, she would interrupt the greetings to
draw her mother’s attention to it, with a twitch of her
shawl, “Oh, look, mamma, at that funny bird in the glass
case!” or perhaps, “Mamma, mamma! There’s a new carpet
since we were here last;” for, as her mother said, she
was “a very observing child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she would wander round the room, examining and
fingering everything, and occasionally coming back with
something in her hand to tread on her mother’s dress, and
break in upon the ladies’ conversation with—“Mamma,
mamma! What’s the good of keeping this old basin! It’s
been broken and mended, and some of the pieces are quite
loose now. I can feel them:” or—addressing the lady of the
house—“That’s not a real ottoman in the corner. It’s a
box covered with chintz. I know, for I’ve looked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then her mamma would say, reprovingly, “My <span class='it'>dear</span>
Amelia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And perhaps the lady of the house would beg, “Don’t
play with that old china, my love; for though it is mended,
it is very valuable;” and her mother would add, “My dear
Amelia, you must not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes the good lady said, “You <span class='it'>must</span> not.” Sometimes
she tried—“You must <span class='it'>not</span>.” When both these failed,
and Amelia was balancing the china bowl on her finger
ends, her mamma would get flurried, and when Amelia flurried
her, she always rolled her r’s, and emphasized her
words, so that it sounded thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear-r-r-r-Ramelia! <span class='sc'>You must not.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At which Amelia would not so much as look round, till
perhaps the bowl slipped from her fingers, and was smashed
into unmendable fragments. Then her mamma would exclaim,
“Oh, dear-r-r-r, oh, dear-r-r-r-Ramelia!” and the
lady of the house would try to look as if it did not matter,
and when Amelia and her mother departed, would pick up
the bits, and pour out her complaints to her lady friends,
most of whom had suffered many such damages at the hands
of this “very observing child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the good couple received their friends at home,
there was no escaping from Amelia. If it was a dinner
party, she came in with the dessert, or perhaps sooner. She
would take up her position near some one, generally the person
most deeply engaged in conversation, and either lean
heavily against him or her, or climb on to his or her knee,
without being invited. She would break in upon the most
interesting discussion with her own little childish affairs,
in the following style—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been out to-day. I walked to the town. I jumped
across three brooks. Can you jump? Papa gave me sixpence
to-day. I am saving up my money to be rich. You
may cut me an orange; no, I’ll take it to Mr. Brown, he
peels it with a spoon and turns the skin back. Mr. Brown!
Mr. Brown! Don’t talk to mamma, but peel me an orange,
please. Mr. Brown! I’m playing with your finger-glass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the finger-glass full of cold water had been upset
on to Mr. Brown’s shirt-front, Amelia’s mamma would
cry—“Oh dear, oh dear-r-Ramelia!” and carry her off with
the ladies to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here she would scramble on to the ladies’ knees, or trample
out the gathers of their dresses, and fidget with their ornaments,
startling some luckless lady by the announcement,
“I’ve got your bracelet undone at last!” who would find
one of the divisions broken open by force, Amelia not understanding
the working of a clasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or perhaps two young lady friends would get into a quiet
corner for a chat. The observing child was sure to spy
them, and run on to them, crushing their flowers and ribbons,
and crying—“You two want to talk secrets, I know.
I can hear what you say. I’m going to listen, I am. And
I shall tell, too.” When perhaps a knock at the door announced
the nurse to take Miss Amelia to bed, and spread a
general rapture of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Amelia would run to trample and worry her mother,
and after much teasing, and clinging, and complaining, the
nurse would be dismissed, and the fond mamma would turn
to the lady next to her, and say with a smile—“I suppose I
must let her stay up a little. It is such a treat to her, poor
child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was no treat to the visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides tormenting her fellow-creatures, Amelia had a
trick of teasing animals. She was really fond of dogs, but
she was still fonder of doing what she was wanted not to do,
and of worrying everything and everybody about her. So
she used to tread on the tips of their tails, and pretend to
give them biscuit, and then hit them on the nose, besides
pulling at those few, long, sensitive hairs which thin-skinned
dogs wear on the upper lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Amelia’s mother’s acquaintances were so very well-bred
and amiable, that they never spoke their minds to
either the mother or the daughter about what they endured
from the latter’s rudeness, wilfulness, and powers of destruction.
But this was not the case with the dogs, and they expressed
their sentiments by many a growl and snap. At
last one day Amelia was tormenting a snow-white bull-dog
(who was certainly as well-bred and as amiable as any living
creature in the kingdom), and she did not see that even his
patience was becoming worn out. His pink nose became
crimson with increased irritation, his upper lip twitched over
his teeth, behind which he was rolling as many warning Rs
as Amelia’s mother herself. She finally held out a bun towards
him, and just as he was about to take it, she snatched
it away and kicked him instead. This fairly exasperated the
bull-dog, and as Amelia would not let him bite the bun, he
bit Amelia’s leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mamma was so distressed that she fell into hysterics,
and hardly knew what she was saying. She said the bull-dog
must be shot for fear he should go mad, and Amelia’s
wound must be done with a red-hot poker for fear <span class='it'>she</span> should
go mad (with hydrophobia). And as of course she couldn’t
bear the pain of this, she must have chloroform, and she
would most probably die of that; for as one in several
thousands dies annually under chloroform, it was evident
that her chance of life was very small indeed. So, as the
poor lady said, “Whether we shoot Amelia and burn the
bull-dog—at least I mean shoot the bull-dog and burn
Amelia with a red-hot poker—or leave it alone; and whether
Amelia or the bull-dog has chloroform or bears it without—it
seems to be death or madness everyway!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the doctor did not come fast enough, she ran out
without her bonnet to meet him, and Amelia’s papa, who
was very much distressed too, ran after her with her bonnet.
Meanwhile the doctor came in by another way, found Amelia
sitting on the dining-room floor with the bull-dog, and crying
bitterly. She was telling him that they wanted to shoot
him, but that they should not, for it was all her fault and
not his. But she did not tell him that she was to be burnt
with a red-hot poker, for she thought it might hurt his feelings.
And then she wept afresh, and kissed the bull-dog,
and the bull-dog kissed her with his red tongue, and rubbed
his pink nose against her, and beat his own tail much harder
on the floor than Amelia had ever hit it. She said the same
things to the doctor, but she told him also that she was willing
to be burnt without chloroform if it must be done, and
if they would spare the bull-dog. And though she looked
very white, she meant what she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the doctor looked at her leg, and found it was only a
snap, and not a deep wound; and then he looked at the
bull-dog, and saw that so far from looking mad, he looked a
great deal more sensible than anybody in the house. So he
only washed Amelia’s leg and bound it up, and she was not
burnt with the poker, neither did she get hydrophobia; but
she had got a good lesson on manners, and thenceforward
she always behaved with the utmost propriety to animals,
though she tormented her mother’s friends as much as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now although Amelia’s mamma’s acquaintances were too
polite to complain before her face, they made up for it by
what they said behind her back. In allusion to the poor
lady’s ineffectual remonstrances, one gentleman said that the
more mischief Amelia did, the dearer she seemed to grow to
her mother. And somebody else replied that however dear
she might be as a daughter, she was certainly a very <span class='it'>dear</span>
friend, and proposed that they should send in a bill for all
the damage she had done in the course of the year, as a round
robin to her parents at Christmas. From which it may be
seen that Amelia was not popular with her parents’ friends,
as (to do grown-up people justice) good children almost invariably
are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she was not a favorite in the drawing-room, she was
still less so in the nursery, where, besides all the hardships
naturally belonging to attendance on a spoilt-child, the poor
nurse was kept, as she said, “on the continual go” by
Amelia’s reckless destruction of her clothes. It was not fair
wear and tear, it was not an occasional fall in the mire, or
an accidental rent or two during a game at “Hunt the
Hare,” but it was constant wilful destruction, which nurse
had to repair as best she might. No entreaties would induce
Amelia to “take care” of anything. She walked obstinately
on the muddy side of the road when nurse pointed out
the clean parts, kicking up the dirt with her feet; if she
climbed a wall she never tried to free her dress if it had
caught; on she rushed, and half a skirt might be left behind
for any care she had in the matter. “They must be
mended,” or, “They must be washed,” was all she thought
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to think things clean and mend themselves,
Miss Amelia,” said poor nurse one day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t,” said Amelia, rudely. “I think you do
them; what are you here for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though she spoke in this insolent and unladylike fashion,
Amelia really did not realize what the tasks were which
her carelessness imposed on other people. When every hour
of nurse’s day had been spent in struggling to keep her wilful
young lady regularly fed, decently dressed, and moderately
well-behaved (except, indeed, those hours when her
mother was fighting the same battle downstairs); and when
at last, after the hardest struggle of all, she had been got to
bed not more than two hours later than her appointed time,
even then there was no rest for nurse. Amelia’s mamma
could at last lean back in her chair and have a quiet chat
with her husband, which was not broken in upon every two
minutes, and Amelia herself was asleep; but nurse must sit
up for hours wearing out her eyes by the light of a tallow
candle, in fine-darning great, jagged and most unnecessary
holes in Amelia’s muslin dresses. Or perhaps she had to
wash and iron clothes for Amelia’s wear next day. For
sometimes she was so very destructive, that towards the end
of the week she had used up all her clothes and had no clean
ones to fall back upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amelia’s meals were another source of trouble. She would
not wear a pinafore; if it had been put on, she would burst
the strings, and perhaps in throwing it away knock her plate
of mutton broth over the tablecloth and her own dress.
Then she fancied first one thing and then another; she did
not like this or that; she wanted a bit cut here and there.
Her mamma used to begin by saying, “My dear-r-Ramelia,
you must not be so wasteful,” and she used to end by saying,
“The dear child has positively no appetite;” which seemed
to be a good reason for not wasting any more food upon her;
but with Amelia’s mamma it only meant that she might try
a little cutlet and tomato sauce when she had half finished
her roast beef, and that most of the cutlet and all the mashed
potato might be exchanged for plum tart and custard; and
that when she had spooned up the custard and played with
the paste, and put the plum stones on the tablecloth, she
might be tempted with a little Stilton cheese and celery, and
exchange that for anything that caught her fancy in the dessert
dishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse used to say, “Many a poor child would thank
God for what you waste every meal time, Miss Amelia,”
and to quote a certain good old saying, “Waste not
want not.” But Amelia’s mamma allowed her to send away
on her plates what would have fed another child, day after
day.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>UNDER THE HAYCOCKS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was summer, and haytime. Amelia had been constantly
in the hayfield, and the haymakers had constantly
wished that she had been anywhere else. She mislaid the
rakes, nearly killed herself and several other persons with a
fork, and overturned one haycock after another as fast as
they were made. At tea time it was hoped that she would
depart, but she teased her mamma to have the tea brought
into the field, and her mamma said, “The poor child must
have a treat sometimes,” and so it was brought out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this she fell off the haycart, and was a good deal
shaken, but not hurt. So she was taken indoors, and the
haymakers worked hard and cleared the field, all but a few
cocks which were left till the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun set, the dew fell, the moon rose. It was a lovely
night. Amelia peeped from behind the blinds of the drawing-room
windows, and saw four haycocks, each with a deep
shadow reposing at its side. The rest of the field was swept
clean, and looked pale in the moonshine. It was a lovely
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to go out,” said Amelia. “They will take away
those cocks before I can get at them in the morning, and
there will be no more jumping and tumbling. I shall go out
and have some fun now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Amelia, you must not,” said her mamma; and
her papa added, “I won’t hear of it.” So Amelia went upstairs
to grumble to nurse; but nurse only said, “Now, my
dear Miss Amelia, do go quietly to bed, like a dear love.
The field is all wet with dew. Besides, it’s a moonlight
night, and who knows what’s abroad? You might see the
fairies—bless us and sain us!—and what not. There’s been
a magpie hopping up and down near the house all day, and
that’s a sign of ill-luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care for magpies,” said Amelia; “I threw a
stone at that one to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she left the nursery, and swung downstairs on the
rail of the banisters. But she did not go into the drawing-room;
she opened the front door and went out into the
moonshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lovely night. But there was something strange
about it. Everything looked asleep, and yet seemed not
only awake but watching. There was not a sound, and yet
the air seemed full of half sounds. The child was quite
alone, and yet at every step she fancied some one behind
her, on one side of her, somewhere, and found it only a rustling
leaf or a passing shadow. She was soon in the hayfield,
where it was just the same; so that when she fancied that
something green was moving near the first haycock she
thought very little of it, till, coming closer, she plainly perceived
by the moonlight a tiny man dressed in green, with a
tall, pointed hat, and very, very long tips to his shoes, tying his
shoestring with his foot on a stubble stalk. He had the
most wizened of faces, and when he got angry with his shoe,
he pulled so wry a grimace that it was quite laughable. At
last he stood up, stepping carefully over the stubble, went
up to the first haycock, and drawing out a hollow grass stalk
blew upon it till his cheeks were puffed like footballs. And
yet there was no sound, only a half-sound, as of a horn
blown in the far distance, or in a dream. Presently the
point of a tall hat, and finally just such another little weazened
face poked out through the side of the haycock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we hold revel here to-night?” asked the little
green man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That indeed you cannot,” answered the other; “we
have hardly room to turn round as it is, with all Amelia’s
dirty frocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, bah!” said the dwarf; and he walked on to the
next haycock, Amelia cautiously following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here he blew again, and a head was put out as before; on
which he said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we hold revel here to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it possible?” was the reply, “when there is not
a place where one can so much as set down an acorn cup,
for Amelia’s broken victuals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fie! fie!” said the dwarf, and went on to the third,
where all happened as before; and he asked the old question—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we hold revel here to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you dance on glass and crockery shreds?” inquired
the other. “Amelia’s broken gimcracks are everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” snorted the dwarf, frowning terribly; and
when he came to the fourth haycock he blew such an angry
blast that the grass stalk split into seven pieces. But he
met with no better success than before. Only the point of
a hat came through the hay, and a feeble voice piped in tones
of depression—“The broken threads would entangle our
feet. It’s all Amelia’s fault. If we could only get hold of
her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she’s wise, she’ll keep as far from these haycocks as
she can,” snarled the dwarf, angrily; and he shook his fist as
much as to say, “If she did come, I should not receive her
very pleasantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now with Amelia, to hear that she had better not do
something, was to make her wish at once to do it; and as
she was not at all wanting in courage, she pulled the dwarf’s
little cloak, just as she would have twitched her mother’s
shawl, and said (with that sort of snarly whine in which
spoilt children generally speak), “Why shouldn’t I come to
the haycocks if I want to? They belong to my papa, and
I shall come if I like. But you have no business here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nightshade and hemlock!” ejaculated the little man,
“you are not lacking in impudence. Perhaps your Sauciness
is not quite aware how things are distributed in this
world?” saying which he lifted his pointed shoes and began
to dance and sing—</p>

<p class='line0'>All under the moon to the fairies.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>As he sang “Ho, ho, ho!” the little man turned head over
heels; and though by this time Amelia would gladly have
got away, she could not, for the dwarf seemed to dance and
tumble round her, and always to cut off the chance of
escape; whilst numberless voices from all around seemed to
join in the chorus, with—</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said the little man, “to work! And you
have plenty of work before you, so trip on, to the first haycock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t!” said Amelia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On with you!” repeated the dwarf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t!” said Amelia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the little man, who was behind her, pinched her funny-bone
with his lean fingers, and, as everybody knows, that is
agony; so Amelia ran on, and tried to get away. But when
she went too fast, the dwarf trod on her heels with his long-pointed
shoe, and if she did not go fast enough, he pinched
her funny-bone. So for once in her life she was obliged to
do as she was told. As they ran, tall hats and wizened faces
were popped out on all sides of the haycocks, like blanched
almonds on a tipsy cake; and whenever the dwarf pinched
Amelia, or trod on her heels, they cried “Ho, ho, ho!”
with such horrible contortions as they laughed, that it was
hideous to behold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is Amelia!” shouted the dwarf when they reached
the first haycock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, ho, ho!” laughed all the others, as they poked out
here and there from the hay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring a stock,” said the dwarf; on which the hay was
lifted, and out ran six or seven dwarfs, carrying what seemed
to Amelia to be a little girl like herself. And when she
looked closer, to her horror and surprise the figure was exactly
like her—it was her own face, clothes, and everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we kick it into the house?” asked the goblins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the dwarf; “lay it down by the haycock. The
father and mother are coming to seek her now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Amelia heard this she began to shriek for help;
but she was pushed into the haycock, where her loudest cries
sounded like the chirruping of a grasshopper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was really a fine sight to see the inside of the cock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farmers do not like to see flowers in a hayfield, but the
fairies do. They had arranged all the buttercups, &amp;c., in
patterns on the haywalls; bunches of meadow-sweet swung
from the roof like censers, and perfumed the air; and the
ox-eye daisies which formed the ceiling gave a light like
stars. But Amelia cared for none of this. She only struggled
to peep through the hay, and she did see her father and
mother and nurse come down the lawn, followed by the other
servants, looking for her. When they saw the stock they
ran to raise it with exclamations of pity and surprise. The
stock moaned faintly, and Amelia’s mamma wept, and
Amelia herself shouted with all her might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” said her mamma. (It is not easy to
deceive a mother.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only the grasshoppers, my dear,” said papa. “Let us
get the poor child home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stock moaned again, and the mother said, “Oh dear!
oh dear-r-Ramelia!” and followed in tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rub her eyes,” said the dwarf; on which Amelia’s eyes
were rubbed with some ointment, and when she took a last
peep, she could see that the stock was nothing but a hairy
imp with a face like the oldest and most grotesque of apes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“——and send her below;” said the dwarf. On which
the field opened, and Amelia was pushed underground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found herself on a sort of open heath, where no houses
were to be seen. Of course there was no moonshine, and yet
it was neither daylight nor dark. There was as the light of
early dawn, and every sound was at once clear and dreamy,
like the first sounds of the day coming through the fresh air
before sunrise. Beautiful flowers crept over the heath, whose
tints were constantly changing in the subdued light; and as
the hues changed and blended, the flowers gave forth different
perfumes. All would have been charming but that at every
few paces the paths were blocked by large clothes-baskets full
of dirty frocks. And the frocks were Amelia’s. Torn,
draggled, wet, covered with sand, mud, and dirt of all kinds,
Amelia recognized them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to wash them all,” said the dwarf, who was
behind her as usual; “that’s what you’ve come down for—not
because your society is particularly pleasant. So the
sooner you begin the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” said Amelia (she had already learnt that “I
won’t” is not an answer for every one); “send them up to
nurse, and she’ll do them. It is her business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nurse can do she has done, and now it’s time for
you to begin,” said the dwarf. “Sooner or later the mischief
done by spoilt children’s wilful disobedience comes back on
their own hands. Up to a certain point we help them, for
we love children, and we are wilful ourselves. But there are
limits to everything. If you can’t wash your dirty frocks, it
is time you learnt to do so, if only that you may know what
the trouble is you impose on other people. <span class='it'>She</span> will teach
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dwarf kicked out his foot in front of him, and pointed
with his long toe to a woman who sat by a fire made upon
the heath, where a pot was suspended from crossed poles. It
was like a bit of a gipsy encampment, and the woman seemed
to be a real woman, not a fairy—which was the case, as
Amelia afterwards found. She had lived underground for
many years, and was the dwarfs’ servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was how it came about that Amelia had to wash
her dirty frocks. Let any little girl try to wash one of her
dresses; not to half wash it, not to leave it stained with
dirty water, but to wash it quite clean. Let her then try to
starch and iron it—in short, to make it look as if it had
come from the laundress—and she will have some idea of
what poor Amelia had to learn to do. There was no help
for it. When she was working she very seldom saw the
dwarfs; but if she were idle or stubborn, or had any hopes
of getting away, one was sure to start up at her elbow and
pinch her funny-bone, or poke her in the ribs, till she did her
best. Her back ached with stooping over the wash-tub; her
hands and arms grew wrinkled with soaking in hot soapsuds,
and sore with rubbing. Whatever she did not know how to
do, the woman of the heath taught her. At first, whilst
Amelia was sulky, the woman of the heath was sharp and
cross; but when Amelia became willing and obedient, she
was good-natured, and even helped her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first time that Amelia felt hungry she asked for some
food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all means,” said one of the dwarfs; “there is plenty
down here which belongs to you;” and he led her away till
they came to a place like the first, except that it was covered
with plates of broken meats; all the bits of good meat, pie,
pudding, bread and butter, &amp;c., that Amelia had wasted beforetime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t eat cold scraps like these,” said Amelia turning
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what did you ask for food for before you were
hungry?” screamed the dwarf, and he pinched her and sent
her about her business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while she became so famished that she was glad to
beg humbly to be allowed to go for food; and she ate a cold
chop and the remains of a rice pudding with thankfulness.
How delicious they tasted! She was surprised herself at the
good things she had rejected. After a time she fancied she
would like to warm up some of the cold meat in a pan, which
the woman of the heath used to cook her own dinner in, and
she asked for leave to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may do anything you like to make yourself comfortable,
if you do it yourself,” said she; and Amelia, who had
been watching her for many times, became quite expert in
cooking up the scraps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As there was no real daylight underground, so also there
was no night. When the old woman was tired she lay down
and had a nap, and when she thought that Amelia had earned
a rest, she allowed her to do the same. It was never cold,
and it never rained, so they slept on the heath among the
flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They say that “It’s a long lane that has no turning,” and
the hardest tasks come to an end some time, and Amelia’s
dresses were clean at last; but then a more wearisome work
was before her. They had to be mended. Amelia looked
at the jagged rents made by the hedges, the great gaping
holes in front where she had put her foot through; the torn
tucks and gathers. First she wept, then she bitterly regretted
that she had so often refused to do her sewing at home that
she was very awkward with her needle. Whether she ever
would have got through this task alone is doubtful, but she
had by this time become so well-behaved and willing that the
old woman was kind to her, and, pitying her blundering
attempts, she helped her a great deal; whilst Amelia would
cook the old woman’s victuals, or repeat stories and pieces of
poetry to amuse her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How glad I am that I ever learnt anything?” thought
the poor child; “everything one learns seems to come useful
some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the dresses were finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think I shall be allowed to go home now?”
Amelia asked of the woman of the heath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet,” said she; “you have got to mend the broken
gimcracks next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when I have done all my tasks,” Amelia said;
“will they let me go then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends,” said the woman, and she sat silent over
the fire; but Amelia wept so bitterly, that she pitied her and
said—“Only dry your eyes, for the fairies hate tears, and I
will tell you all I know and do the best for you I can. You
see, when you first came you were—excuse me!—such an
unlicked cub; such a peevish, selfish, wilful, useless, and ill-mannered
little miss, that neither the fairies nor anybody
else were likely to keep you any longer than necessary. But
now you are such a willing, handy, and civil little thing, and
so pretty and graceful withal, and I think it is very likely
that they will want to keep you altogether. I think you had
better make up your mind to it. They are kindly little
folk, and will make a pet of you in the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no!” moaned poor Amelia; “I want to be
with my mother, my poor dear mother! I want to make up
for being a bad child so long. Besides, surely that ‘stock,’
as they called her, will want to come back to her own people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to that,” said the woman, “after a time the stock
will affect mortal illness, and will then take possession of the
first black cat she sees, and in that shape leave the house,
and come home. But the figure that is like you will remain
lifeless in the bed, and will be duly buried. Then your
people, believing you to be dead, will never look for you, and
you will always remain here. However, as this distresses
you so, I will give you some advice. Can you dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Amelia; “I did attend pretty well to my
dancing lessons. I was considered rather clever about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any spare moments you find,” continued the woman,
“dance, dance all your dances, and as well as you can. The
dwarfs love dancing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?” said Amelia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, perhaps some night they will take you up to dance
with them in the meadows above ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I could not get away. They would tread on my
heels—oh! I could never escape them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that,” said the woman; “your only chance is
this. If ever, when dancing in the meadows, you can find
a four-leaved clover, hold it in your hand and wish to be at
home. Then no one can stop you. Meanwhile I advise
you to seem happy, and they may think you are content,
and have forgotten the world. And dance, above all,
dance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Amelia, not to be behindhand, began then and there
to dance some pretty figures on the heath. As she was dancing
the dwarf came by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, ho!” said he, “you can dance, can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I am happy, I can,” said Amelia, performing
several graceful movements as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you pleased about now?” snapped the dwarf,
suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I not reason?” said Amelia. “The dresses are
washed and mended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then up with them!” returned the dwarf. On which
half a dozen elves popped the whole lot into a big basket and
kicked them up into the world, where they found their way
to the right wardrobes somehow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the woman of the heath had said, Amelia was soon set
to a new task. When she bade the old woman farewell, she
asked if she could do nothing for her if ever she got at liberty
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I do nothing to get you back to your old home?”
Amelia cried, for she thought of others now as well as herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” returned the old woman; “I am used
to this, and do not care to return. I have been here a long
time—how long I do not know; for as there is neither daylight
nor dark we have no measure of time—long, I am sure,
very long. The light and noise up yonder would now be too
much for me. But I wish you well, and, above all, remember
to dance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new scene of Amelia’s labors was a more rocky part
of the heath, where grey granite boulders served for seats
and tables, and sometimes for workshops and anvils, as in
one place, where a grotesque and grimy old dwarf sat forging
rivets to mend china and glass. A fire in a hollow of
the boulder served for a forge, and on the flatter part was his
anvil. The rocks were covered in all directions with the
knick-knacks, ornaments, &amp;c., that Amelia had at various
times destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, sir,” she said to the dwarf, “I am
Amelia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dwarf left off blowing at his forge and looked at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I wonder you’re not ashamed of yourself,” said
he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am ashamed of myself,” said poor Amelia, “very
much ashamed. I should like to mend these things if I
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can’t say more than that,” said the dwarf, in
a mollified tone, for he was a kindly little creature; “bring
that china bowl here, and I’ll show you how to set to
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Amelia did not get on very fast, but she tried her
best. As to the dwarf, it was truly wonderful to see how he
worked. Things seemed to mend themselves at his touch,
and he was so proud of his skill, and so particular, that he
generally did over again the things which Amelia had done
after her fashion. The first time he gave her a few minutes
in which to rest and amuse herself, she held out her little
skirt, and began one of her prettiest dances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rivets and trivets!” shrieked the little man, “How you
dance! It is charming! I say it is charming! On with
you! Fa, la fa! La, fa la! It gives me the fidgets in my
shoe points to see you!” and forthwith down he jumped,
and began capering about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a good dancer myself,” said the little man, “Do
you know the ‘Hop, Skip, and Jump’ dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think I do,” said Amelia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is much admired,” said the dwarf, “when I dance
it;” and he thereupon tucked up the little leathern apron in
which he worked, and performed some curious antics on one
leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the Hop,” he observed, pausing for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Skip is thus. You throw out your left leg as high
and as far as you can, and as you drop on the toe of your
left foot you fling out the right leg in the same manner, and
so on. This is the Jump,” with which he turned a somersault
and disappeared from view. When Amelia next saw
him he was sitting cross-legged on his boulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good, wasn’t it?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful!” Amelia replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now it’s your turn again,” said the dwarf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Amelia cunningly replied—“I’m afraid I must go on
with my work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” said the little tinker. “Give me your work.
I can do more in a minute than you in a month, and better
to boot. Now dance again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know this?” said Amelia, and she danced a few
paces of a polka mazurka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Admirable!” cried the little man. “Stay”—and he
drew an old violin from behind the rock; “now dance again,
and mark the time well, so that I may catch the measure,
and then I will accompany you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which accordingly he did, improvising a very spirited
tune, which had, however, the peculiar subdued and weird
effect of all the other sounds in this strange region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fiddle came from up yonder,” said the little man.
“It was smashed to atoms in the world and thrown away.
But ho, ho, ho! There is nothing that I cannot mend, and
a mended fiddle is an amended fiddle. It improves the tone.
Now teach me that dance, and I will patch up all the rest
of the gimcracks. Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all means,” said Amelia; and she began to explain
the dance to the best of her ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charming! charming!” cried the dwarf. “We have no
such dance ourselves. We only dance hand in hand, and
round and round, when we dance together. Now I will
learn the step, and then I will put my arm round your waist
and dance with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amelia looked at the dwarf. He was very smutty, and
old, and weazened. Truly, a queer partner! But “handsome
is that handsome does;” and he had done her a good
turn. So when he had learnt the step, he put his arm round
Amelia’s waist, and they danced together. His shoe points
were very much in the way, but otherwise he danced very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he set to work on the broken ornaments, and they
were all very soon “as good as new.” But they were not
kicked up into the world, for, as the dwarfs said, they would
be sure to break on the road. So they kept them and used
them; and I fear that no benefit came from the little tinker’s
skill to Amelia’s mamma’s acquaintance in this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I any other tasks?” Amelia inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One more,” said the dwarfs; and she was led farther on
to a smooth mossy green, thickly covered with what looked
like bits of broken thread. One would think it had been a
milliner’s work-room from the first invention of needles and
thread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are these?” Amelia asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are the broken threads of all the conversations
you have interrupted,” was the reply; “and pretty dangerous
work it is to dance here now, with threads getting round
one’s shoe points. Dance a hornpipe in a herring-net, and
you’ll know what it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amelia began to pick up the threads, but it was tedious
work. She had cleared a yard or two, and her back was
aching terribly, when she heard the fiddle and the mazurka
behind her; and looking round she saw the old dwarf, who
was playing away, and making the most hideous grimaces as
his chin pressed the violin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dance, my lady, dance!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think I can,” said Amelia; “I am so weary
with stooping over my work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then rest a few minutes,” he answered, “and I will play
you a jig. A jig is a beautiful dance, such life, such spirit!
So!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he played faster and faster, his arm, his face, his fiddle-bow
all seemed working together; and as he played, the
threads danced themselves into three heaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not bad, is it?” said the dwarf; “and now for
our own dance,” and he played the mazurka. “Get the
measure well into your head. Lâ, la fa lâ! Lâ, la fa lâ!
So!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And throwing away his fiddle, he caught Amelia round
the waist, and they danced as before. After which, she had
no difficulty in putting the three heaps of thread into a
basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are these to be kicked to?” asked the young
goblins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the four winds of heaven,” said the old dwarf.
“There are very few drawing-room conversations worth putting
together a second time. They are not like old china
bowls.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BY MOONLIGHT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Thus</span> Amelia’s tasks were ended; but not a word was
said of her return home. The dwarfs were now very kind,
and made so much of her that it was evident that they
meant her to remain with them. Amelia often cooked for
them, and she danced and played with them, and never
showed a sign of discontent; but her heart ached for home,
and when she was alone she would bury her face in the
flowers and cry for her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day she overheard the dwarfs in consultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The moon is full to-morrow,” said one—(“Then I have
been a month down here,” thought Amelia; “it was full
moon that night”)—“shall we dance in the Mary Meads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all means,” said the old tinker dwarf; “and we will
take Amelia, and dance my dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it safe?” said another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look how content she is,” said the old dwarf; “and,
oh! how she dances; my feet tickle at the bare thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ordinary run of mortals do not see us,” continued
the objector; “but she is visible to any one. And there are
men and women who wander in the moonlight, and the Mary
Meads are near her old home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will make her a hat of touchwood,” said the old dwarf,
“so that even if she is seen it will look like a will-o’-the-wisp
bobbing up and down. If she does not come, I will not. I
must dance my dance. You do not know what it is! We
two alone move together with a grace which even here is
remarkable. But when I think that up yonder we shall have
attendant shadows echoing our movements, I long for the
moment to arrive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it,” said the others; and Amelia wore the touchwood
hat, and went up with them to the Mary Meads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amelia and the dwarf danced the mazurka, and their
shadows, now as short as themselves, then long and gigantic,
danced beside them. As the moon went down, and the
shadows lengthened, the dwarf was in raptures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one sees how colossal one’s very shadow is,” he
remarked, “one knows one’s true worth. You also have a
good shadow. We are partners in the dance, and I think
we will be partners for life. But I have not fully considered
the matter, so this is not to be regarded as a formal proposal.”
And he continued to dance, singing, “Lâ, la, fa, lâ, lâ, la, fa,
lâ.” It was highly admired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mary Meads lay a little below the house where
Amelia’s parents lived, and once during the night her father,
who was watching by the sick bed of the stock, looked out
of the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lovely the moonlight is!” he murmured; “but,
dear me! there is a will-o’-the-wisp yonder. I had no idea
the Mary Meads were so damp.” Then he pulled the blind
down and went back into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for poor Amelia, she found no four-leaved clover, and
at cockcrow they all went underground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will dance on Hunch Hill to-morrow,” said the
dwarfs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All went as before; not a clover plant of any kind did
Amelia see, and at cockcrow the revel broke up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following night they danced in the hayfield. The
old stubble was now almost hidden by green clover. There
was a grand fairy dance—a round dance, which does not
mean, as with us, a dance for two partners, but a dance
where all join hands and dance round and round in a circle
with appropriate antics. Round they went, faster and faster,
the pointed shoes now meeting in the centre like the
spokes of a wheel now kicked out behind like spikes, and
then scamper, caper, hurry! They seemed to fly, when
suddenly the ring broke at one corner, and nothing being
stronger than its weakest point, the whole circle were sent
flying over the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, ho, ho!” laughed the dwarfs, for they are good-humored
little folk, and do not mind a tumble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed Amelia, for she had fallen with
her fingers on a four-leaved clover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put it behind her back, for the old tinker dwarf was
coming up to her, wiping the mud from his face with his
leathern apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for our dance!” he shrieked. “And I have made
up my mind—partners now and partners always. You are
incomparable. For three hundred years I have not met
with your equal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Amelia held the four-leaved clover above her head,
and cried from her very heart—“I want to go home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dwarf gave a hideous yell of disappointment, and at
this instant the stock came stumbling head over heels into
the midst, crying—“Oh! the pills, the powders, and the
draughts! oh, the lotions and embrocations! oh, the blisters,
the poultices, and the plasters! men may well be so short-lived!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Amelia found herself in bed in her own home.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AT HOME AGAIN.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>By</span> the side of Amelia’s bed stood a little table, on which
were so many big bottles of medicine, that Amelia smiled to
think of all the stock must have had to swallow during the
month past. There was an open Bible on it too, in which
Amelia’s mother was reading, whilst tears trickled slowly
down her pale cheeks. The poor lady looked so thin and ill,
so worn with sorrow and watching, that Amelia’s heart
smote her, as if some one had given her a sharp blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma, mamma! Mother, my dear, dear, mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tender, humble, loving tone of voice was so unlike
Amelia’s old imperious snarl, that her mother hardly recognized
it; and when she saw Amelia’s eyes full of intelligence
instead of the delirium of fever, and that (though older and
thinner and rather pale) she looked wonderfully well, the
poor worn-out lady could hardly restrain herself from falling
into hysterics for very joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear mamma, I want to tell you all about it,” said
Amelia, kissing the kind hand that stroked her brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it appeared that the doctor had forbidden conversation;
and though Amelia knew it would do her no harm, she
yielded to her mother’s wish and lay still and silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my love, it is time to take your medicine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Amelia pleaded—“Oh, mamma, indeed I don’t want
any medicine. I am quite well, and would like to get up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my dear child!” cried her mother, “what I have
suffered in inducing you to take your medicine, and yet see
what good it has done you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will never suffer any more from my wilfulness,”
said Amelia; and she swallowed two tablespoonfuls
of a mixture labelled, “To be well shaken before taken,”
without even a wry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the doctor came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not so very angry at the sight of me to-day my
little lady, eh?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not seen you for a long time,” said Amelia;
“but I know you have been here, attending a stock who
looked like me. If your eyes had been touched with fairy
ointment, however, you would have been aware that it was a
fairy imp, and a very ugly one, covered with hair. I have
been living in terror lest it should go back underground in
the shape of a black cat. However, thanks to the four-leaved
clover, and the old woman of the heath, I am at
home again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On hearing this rhodomontade, Amelia’s mother burst
into tears, for she thought the poor child was still raving
with fever. But the doctor smiled pleasantly, and said—“Ay,
ay, to be sure,” with a little nod, as one should say,
“We know all about it;” and laid two fingers in a casual
manner on Amelia’s wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she is wonderfully better, madam,” he said afterwards
to her mamma; “the brain has been severely tried,
but she is marvellously improved: in fact, it is an effort of
nature, a most favorable effort, and we can but assist the
rally; we will change the medicine.” Which he did, and
very wisely assisted nature with a bottle of pure water
flavored with tincture of roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was so very kind of him to give me his directions
in poetry,” said Amelia’s mamma; “for I told him my
memory, which is never good, seemed going completely, from
anxiety, and if I had done anything wrong just now, I
should never had forgiven myself. And I always found
poetry easier to remember than prose,”—which puzzled
everybody, the doctor included, till it appeared that she had
ingeniously discovered a rhyme in his orders</p>

<p class='noindent'>Under which treatment Amelia was soon pronounced to be
well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made another attempt to relate her adventures, but she
found that not even the nurse would believe in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why you told me yourself I might meet with the fairies,”
said Amelia, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I did, my dear,” nurse replied, “and they say that
it’s that put it into your head. And I’m sure what you say
about the dwarfs and all is as good as a printed book, though
you can’t think that ever I would have let any dirty clothes
store up like that, let alone your frocks, my dear. But for
pity sake, Miss Amelia, don’t go on about it to your mother,
for she thinks you’ll never get your senses right again, and
she has fretted enough about you, poor lady; and nursed you
night and day till she is nigh worn out. And anybody can
see you’ve been ill, miss, you’ve grown so, and look paler and
older like. Well, to be sure, as you say, if you’d been
washing and working for a month in a place without a bit of
sun, or a bed to lie on, and scraps to eat, it would be enough
to do it; and many’s the poor child that has to, and gets
worn and old before her time. But, my dear, whatever you
think, give in to your mother; you’ll never repent giving in
to your mother, my dear, the longest day you live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Amelia kept her own counsel. But she had one confidant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her parents brought the stock home on the night of
Amelia’s visit to the haycocks, the bull-dog’s conduct had
been most strange. His usual good-humor appeared to have
been exchanged for incomprehensible fury, and he was with
difficulty prevented from flying at the stock, who on her part
showed an anger and dislike fully equal to his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally the bull-dog had been confined in the stable, where
he remained the whole month, uttering from time to time
such howls, with his snub nose in the air, that poor nurse
quite gave up hope of Amelia’s recovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For indeed, my dear, they do say that a howling dog is a
sign of death, and it was more than I could abear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the day after Amelia’s return, as nurse was leaving
the room with a tray which had carried some of the light
nourishing diet ordered by the doctor, she was knocked down,
tray and all, by the bull-dog, who came tearing into the room,
dragging a chain and dirty rope after him, and nearly choked
by the desperate efforts which had finally effected his escape
from the stable. And he jumped straight on the end of
Amelia’s bed, where he lay, <span class='it'>thudding</span> with his tail, and giving
short whines of ecstacy. And as Amelia begged that he
might be left, and as it was evident that he would bite any
one who tried to take him away, he became established as
chief nurse. When Amelia’s meals were brought to the
bedside on a tray, he kept a fixed eye on the plates, as if to
see if her appetite were improving. And he would even
take a snack himself, with an air of great affability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Amelia told him her story, she could see by his
eyes, and his nose, and his ears, and his tail, and the way he
growled whenever the stock was mentioned, that he knew all
about it. As, on the other hand, he had no difficulty in conveying
to her by sympathetic whines the sentiment “Of
course I would have helped you if I could; but they tied me
up, and this disgusting old rope has taken me a month to
worry through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, in spite of the past, Amelia grew up good and gentle,
unselfish and considerate for others. She was unusually
clever, as those who have been with the “Little People”
are said always to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she became so popular with her mother’s acquaintances
that they said—“We will no longer call her Amelia, for it
was a name we learnt to dislike, but we will call her Amy,
that is to say, ‘Beloved.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did my godmother’s grandmother believe that Amelia
had really been with the fairies, or did she think it was all
fever ravings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, indeed, she never said, but she always observed
that it was a pleasant tale with a good moral, which was
surely enough for anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> clear, smooth brow of Mrs. St. James clouded
and contracted unmistakably. As she stood at the
window, her eyes wandering about the beautiful
grounds surrounding her home, they rested on two
figures seated in a rustic arbor. They were her
daughter Alice and young Gerald Clifton. Now Mrs.
St. James would have preferred seeing any other of
the young gentlemen of her acquaintance with Alice,
than the present one. She turned impatiently from
the window, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My remonstrance is useless. She is perfectly infatuated—and
her father scarcely less so. I can’t
imagine what he is thinking about. He has not a
care about his child making a brilliant match. There
is Albert Hyde, young Lord Clavering, and half a
dozen others, any of whom she could marry; all eligible,
and should be considered really more desirable
and worthy. But no—this young man, with neither
wealth nor position, has, I fear, secured the hearts of
both Alice and her father. And I really think, unless
something providential prevents, she will marry him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lovely Alice, quite unconscious of the unfavorable
eyes which had lingered on them, was listening
with delight to a beautiful poem her lover was reading.
Suddenly he closed the book, and looking earnestly
on his companion, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother dislikes me very much, Alice. I
fear I shall never win her favor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, not dislikes you; but there are others she
likes better, perhaps. But papa will yet win her over.
He loves you, and mamma dearly loves him. So in
time all will be well,” answered Alice, with a sweet,
assuring smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust so, Alice. And in time I will prove worthy
of your love and your father’s confidence. I will make
a name for you, love, with heaven’s blessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week or so after, Sydney St. James was returning
home from his editorial office. He had had a harassing
day, and was very tired. He wanted rest, and a
quiet evening; saying to himself, “I trust we shall
have no company, unless Gerald; he never wearies me.
Bless the boy! I am growing strangely fond of him!”
He entered the house, made his way to the parlor,
where he was accustomed to find his family. Alas!
for his hopes of rest and quiet. There, instead of the
usual pleasant greeting from his wife, the bright smile
and loving embrace of his daughter, he found the first
very much excited, with flashing eyes and glowing
cheeks; the latter sobbing, her face hidden in the cushion
of the sofa. Hastily approaching her, he raised
her head tenderly and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another rush of tears; then her head nestled in her
father’s bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened?” he asked, in real anxiety
looking to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I always knew something was wrong about
him, and how very presumptuous he was; but I never
did suppose he would descend to such a low, crim—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma! oh! don’t, pray!” sobbed Alice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He! Who? What is it?” asked Mr. St. James,
growing more and more anxious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your great favorite, Mr. Clifton, was here at
noon, to take leave of Alice, before leaving for Scotland.
We were about going out shopping when he
came; so of course were detained. I drew off my
gloves, and laid them, with my porte-monnaie, handkerchief
and sunshade, on the center table. I saw him
take up the porte-monnaie, and look at it; I thought
just admiring it. You know it was that pearl and inlaid
one you gave me at Christmas. Well, after a little
while I went into the next room, immediately returning
when I heard him about leaving. I bade him good-by
in the hall, and proceeded to draw on my gloves
again, intending to go on our proposed excursion. I
missed the porte-monnaie; but, thinking Alice had put
it in her pocket, I was not anxious. When she was
again ready to start, I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You have the money?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No,’ she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We began to look about, but our hunt was in vain.
You can readily arrive at the conclusion, and the
cause of Alice’s mortification and grief,” said Mrs. St.
James, in a manner and tone that looked and sounded
very much like she was rather glad of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you for a moment imagine, or would have
me, that Clifton—” Mr. St. James hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stole it? Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another sob from Alice, with the cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t—don’t, mamma!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut, tut, tut, wife. Hush, Alice, love. There is
some mistake. I’d risk all my worldly possessions—aye,
and my life—on Gerald’s honesty and noble
nature,” said Mr. St. James.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would lose both, then. There is no mistake,
my dear. You know he has been much embarrassed
in money matters. I know no one entered this room
but him; and I know the porte-monnaie is gone, and in
it a hundred pounds. You can call it by what name
you choose. I have my own idea about the matter.
However, should you put it in the mildest form, kleptomania
would not be a very desirable acquisition to
our family. Alice, I think, feels fully sensible of that.
Why you have thought so much of him I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” and the dark brown eyes of Sydney St.
James grew more earnest, and glowed with a tender,
loving light; and in a voice full of emotion, he said:
“Why? Because I, who have no son of my own, see
in this young man a reproduction of myself—the
struggles of my youth. So much he brings to my
mind those years of trial—oh, those long, weary
heart-sickening years!—when, alone in my humble,
cheerless room, I brewed my own coffee, broiled my
chops, and worked—worked, day and night, so long
before I could get any production accepted, and then
for many months after, before I received any remuneration.
And then how small it was! how meagerly
dealt out! Aye, and in the very act of which you accuse
him, most forcibly I see the great resemblance
between us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the time when the ‘Prison Reform Bill’ was
very much engrossing the public mind, my fortunes
took a favorable turn. I wrote a leader on that subject.
It was published, and although I am sure it was
no better than many I had written before, pleased the
people. A few days after, when in the office of the
editor of the journal in which my productions were
principally published, that gentleman handed me a
note, which opening I found was from the Secretary
of the Premier, saying his lordship would be pleased
to see me, and appointing the next day for my call.
Lord Cedarcliff received me most kindly, complimenting
me on that article, that really proved the
making of my present success. That call was the beginning
of my intimacy with his lordship. A few
days after, I was invited to a dinner party given by
Lord Cedarcliff. There I met many of the noble and
distinguished men of the time. It was my first dinner
party, and naturally I was considerably embarrassed.
However, his lordship’s kindness, and the
marked attention of many of his guests, placed me
more at ease. During the dinner, Lord Cedarcliff
called our attention to a gold spoon, curiously wrought
and very valuable. It was said to have belonged to
the camp equipage of Napoleon. The conversation
then, from the Emperor and his battles, naturally
turned to those of the Crimea, and the prolonged
siege of Sebastopol. Several of the gentlemen expressed
their views as to how the city might have
been taken; and I, considerably excited by the wine,
and like most young men, possessing my full share of
egotism, had my ideas about the matter. So I began
to explain how Sebastopol might have been taken
very speedily. With the handle of the Emperor’s
spoon, I marked my plan on the table-cloth. After
a little I became conscious that a silence more than
profound, really painful, had fallen upon the company.
I felt confident it could not have been occasioned
by their great interest in my theme. I had
wearied them, most likely, or perhaps I had said or
done something very <span class='it'>outré</span>. The embarrassment was
somewhat relieved by his lordship’s making the move
for our adjournment to the drawing-room. There,
however, I could not fail to observe that I had in some
way lost favor. His lordship was <span class='it'>too</span> polite, frigidly
so. In truth, the whole atmosphere seemed changed.
At length I excused myself, and left, sadly mystified
as to the change, in not only his lordship’s treatment
of me, but likewise of most of his guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few days after, I called on Lord Cedarcliff, but
was told by the butler that his lordship was engaged;
again, the next day, with the same result; a third time,
with no better success. Determining to press the
matter a little, and find out, if possible, what such
treatment meant, I asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘When can I see his lordship?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judge of my mortification, when the butler replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It will not be agreeable for his lordship to receive
Mr. St. James now, or at any future time.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not imagine what I had done to merit such
a change in the Premier’s kind feeling. In vain I
asked myself, over and over, ‘What did I say or do at
the dinner-table?’ for I was sensible the change took
place there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That evening I was engaged to go with a friend to
the opera. I felt in no mood for such enjoyment, I
was so depressed by my reception at the Premier’s
mansion. However, my friend would not excuse me,
and so I began getting ready to accompany him.
Taking from the closet my only dress coat—indeed,
I may say, my only respectable one—which was kept
for great occasions, I began to brush and dust it—I
had not worn it since the Premier’s dinner party.
While thus engaged, the brush struck against something
in the pocket. Putting my hand in to ascertain
what it was, I drew out—oh, horror!—the Emperor’s
golden spoon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mystery was solved, then. I had pocketed
that spoon while seated at his lordship’s table.
Many times—in fact, I was accustomed, when
deeply interested in conversation, to pocket pens,
pencils, knives, handkerchiefs and napkins; but never
before anything of much value. For a moment I
was so overwhelmed with mortification I could only
gaze wildly from the spoon to my friend. Then,
hurriedly pulling on my coat, I caught up my hat,
still grasping the spoon, rushed out of the room, down
the stairs, and into the street. My companion started
to follow me, calling out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘St. James, are you mad? Stop! I must go
with you!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stopped not nor deigned a word of reply, but
rushed on through the streets until I reached the
Premier’s dwelling. I rang the bell, and when the
butler opened the door, I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I must see his lordship. Tell him it is a matter
of life and death!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My excited manner testified to the urgency of my
case, so the man turned to do my bidding. With
quick, noiseless steps I followed behind him. He
opened the door of his lordship’s sanctum, but before
he opened his mouth to speak, I rushed past him, and
up to the nobleman’s side, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My lord, here is your spoon—that Emperor’s
spoon! On my honor—’ Excited as I was, I could
detect a curl of the haughty lip, as if to signify his
lordship’s doubt of my possessing that quality. ‘Ah,
I fear you think I know nothing of such a feeling,’ I
continued; ‘but, as heaven hears me, I had no more
idea of having taken that spoon, until fifteen minutes
ago, than your lordship has now of having purloined
the crown jewels.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My look, words and manner enforced conviction.
After an instant his lordship grasped my hand, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I believe you, St. James. I wonder, now, how
I could ever have doubted you. I might have known
how it was.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So excited had I been, I failed to notice the room
had other occupants. A merry laugh reached my ear.
Turning, I saw several gentlemen who were present at
the dinner party. They came forward, each grasping
my hand cordially, and apologizing for their suspicions.
The story was told many times after, and
afforded considerable amusement. And after a while
I could join in the laugh; but for a long time it was a
very sore subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Alice, love, rest easy. I’ll answer for Gerald.
We will hear from him before long; just as soon
as he has made the discovery. Come, smile, now; and—Ah,
there is the dinner bell. I cannot have a clouded
face near me. It will take away my appetite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice tried to smile, but it proved a poor apology
for one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were just about entering the dining-room,
when a servant met them, holding out an envelope,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A telegram, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly opening which, Mr. St. James exclaimed
joyously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I knew it! It is from Gerald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was from Peterborough, addressed to Mr. St.
James, and read:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“Took, by mistake, an article of value from your
house. Will return with it by the next train.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless the boy! How could you have doubted him,
Alice? <span class='it'>You</span>, of all others! I can scarcely forgive
you,” her father said, affectionately chiding her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice’s face was radiant with smiles then, and she
whispered in her father’s ear:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gerald will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few hours more and young Clifton was with them,
and the porte-monnaie restored to the owner. The
event served to bind more firmly the affection of Mr.
St. James to his favorite, who, in a year after, became
his son-in-law and in time not only fulfilled the great
expectation of St. James, but quite reconciled Mrs.
St. James to the fact of Alice’s husband bearing no
lordly title, but one won by his own merit. And
that worthy lady has been more cautious in pronouncing
so decidedly upon the actions of <span class='it'>literary</span>
folk, since the event of the missing porte-monnaie
and the hearing of her husband’s story; and she is
often heard to say now, that “deep thinkers, who are
nearly all the time planning the future, cannot be expected

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
